16,history,"This question came to me after hearing (on video) someone say that [paraphrasing] America was started by European immigrants killing and pushing out the indigenous people, and taking over their lands; now it is a nation of immigrants, and the true native peoples are a tiny minority located in isolated enclaves.

Now, I don't want to start a discussion/argument about the phrasing or attitude of the above position (it's not my position). I want to ask about the concept. I only include the above to hopefully more clearly communicate what I'm asking (by showing the seed of the thought).

Is the American settlement and expansion a historically unique pattern? That is, an obviously/distinctly different people moving into a land, and essentially completely overtaking and replacing the native people as the overwhelmingly dominant race/ethnicity/culture/etc.? Within, what, 200 years? Is that fast or slow compared to other examples?

I know there have been migrations, invasions, etc. throughout human history, all over the world. But I don't know if any of them are on the same scale as in America -- such vastly different ""sides"" (racially/ethnically, culturally, technologically, etc., who didn't even know the other existed), and on such a vast geographical area. 

If this scale is not unique with America, what were the other such massive and thorough migrations and overtakes? What nations now have a population that is completely different than the one that used to live there (without going back thousands of years)? 

I think the Romans were notably different than some of the peoples they conquered and included in the empire, but Roman people didn't really move into those areas and take over as the dominant population (or even a sizable minority), right? It was mostly administrative empire -- correct me if I'm wrong.

Also: I'm saying ""America"" here mostly meaning North America. I've not studied South America's history as much, but I think it's quite a bit different both in how non-indigenous settlement and expansion happened, and how it is currently considered (the real and perceived results).

",Is American settlement/expansion unique?

The India Pride Project, which was instrumental in the restitution of a 12th century Buddha statue stolen from Nalanda in Bihar last year via the Indian High Commission in London, said it would continue lobbying for such artefacts to find their way back to India.

“You haven’t really decolonised a nation, unless you’ve given back what’s theirs,” said Anuraag Saxena, founder of the India Pride Project.

39,history,"Most dictionaries have two different definitions for myths or mythologies:

1. Traditional stories often explaining how things came to be
2. Widely held false beliefs

Normally, Greek Mythology would be classified as the first type and the Medieval Flat Earth Myth as the second, but I keep finding parallels between them.

""The Greeks and Romans were really smart, but then the Evil Church™ came and killed off all knowledge and burned down the Library of Alexandria and caused the Dark Ages and burned 9 million witches that all had red hair, until Da Vinci/Columbus/Copernicus/Galileo dared question the Church's authority and brought us back into the light, and that's why we are allowed to think critically now."" seems a lot like traditional myths when looking at the picture as a whole.

There are alternate versions of events (Did Columbus or Galileo get in trouble for claiming the earth was round?) just like Aphrodite is either the daughter of Zeus and Dione or she formed from the foam when Cronos severed Uranus' gentials. And sometimes there are regional variants (Redheads burned as witches seems to be a uniquely German claim, it isn't claimed as often in English-speaking countries).

And, of course, it's an entire interconnected mess of myths, some of them more specific (The Evil Christians burning down the Library of Alexandria, the Church/Pope declaring the Earth to be flat, the Church/Pope banning Arabic numerals, the Church/Pope banning the number zero)

Some of them more generalized, spanning the whole 1000-year time period (Everyone threw their dung onto the streets, nobody bathed, science lay dormant, the Inquisition killed everyone who disagreed with them).

Some myths have some sort of historical basis but are exaggerated beyond recognition (The Plague was present **the entire time**)

The Black Legend would be a sort of in-between collection of myths, starting out as specifically anti-Spanish but then influencing the grand overarching narrative (exaggeration of the Inquisition)

Could all of this be considered an entire Mythos? If so, what name would there be for it? The Black Legend is already a designation for a part of it, but the most I can find for the Mythos as a whole is the ""Dark Ages Myth"", the ""Conflict Thesis"" or ""The Graph"".

So yeah, ***your life***, all of the connections, and experiences, and all of the mess-ups and successes you've had are worth about \~1/2 an inch of no man's land. ***Half a fucking inch.***

To put it in perspective, the average town in the US had a population of at or below about \~2500 people. So, the life of every man, woman, and child, every last person you've ever known ***in your entire life***, would buy 100 feet of no man's land. Yeah.

I was just watching Black Mirror on Netflix. There is an episode about ethnic cleansing called Men Against Fire. In this episode, the Army psychologist said that in the previous wars, many soldiers wouldn't shoot back when attacked. Most soldiers who fired their weapon aimed over the heads of their enemies to purposely miss because they couldn't handle killing another human being. He cited the world wars and the Vietnam war. He gave statistics that only about 15% were actually trying to shoot the enemy.

124,history,"Basically, the old style history documentaries where they constantly heap praise on the topic, explain a few things they did, and then say a generalized narration of events without giving you a very insightful understanding of it or the context which it occurred. I remember watching a documentary in one of my classes about Louis XIV, and they were constantly complimenting him, saying how great he was, about how powerful he was, but they never mentioned a single thing he did. I was just baffled, I mean I knew what he did but the fact that a professional documentary series couldn't convey his story in an interesting way is baffling.

&amp;#x200B;

This comes up because I was watching the Rome documentary series on Netflix, and as soon as they began doing the same thing, heaping praise, calling Rome ""the Greatest Civilization"" with numerous technological advances in sanitation with aqueducts (implying that no one else was doing it) I just stopped watching. They get these esteemed scholars and they keep this kind of out of date format? Or this incredibly exaggerated image of it? They even mentioned the repeated assertion that the city of Rome had a million people, which i'm pretty sure was never confirmed.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels alot like the people making them are so afraid of boring their audience with details and names that they just stick to more childish ways of presenting the information like ""this man good, real good, he do a b c, he do good job you love him"", with no attempt at presenting a more in depth understanding. No attempt at trying to get rid of some common misunderstandings of history. I don't know if these types of documentaries are meant to be for an elementary or a middle school, but it just feels kind of disappointing that they don't try to explain complex historical events. I've read a couple books on historical people and events, and I get how hard it can be to keep track of whats going on when they're throwing around a bunch of names, but it's still possible to present the information in a way that is compelling.

Now on to my question: I’m just confused as to how anti-septic techniques weren’t common-sense? These people knew that having infected bodies next to other patients led to the spread of disease, and blamed infection in things such as “a putrefaction of the surrounding air” etc. They knew that surgical mortality rates were higher in hospitals than the same surgeries performed at home. I just don’t see how, even if you don’t know what’s exactly causing infection, that you wouldn’t think to clean instruments of the grime and gore of previous surgeries before working on another patient. On top of that, I also don’t understand why surgeons at the time viewed microscopes as useless for the study of medicine... Any historians of science and medicine, help me out here!

In Åkerby church archives there is an old protocol, the memory of a peculiar event from the late 17th century. A parish priest had accidentally started laughing loudly, in the middle of delivering a sermon from the pulpit. He stod before the cathedral chapter, accused by the parishmen of this offensive behavior and defended himself thus: He had during his sermon seen a billy-goat solemnly walking up the church ile. Upon noticing a woman, who had fallen asleep due to the summer heat and sat there nodding, the goat took this as a challenge and headbutted her so that her legs for a moment sought the sky.

129,history,"I'm leaning towards self-interest as it started during ww1 when the allies wanted to resurrect an eastern front and prevent the central powers getting materials sent by the allies to russia. On the other hand the allies had clear distain against Bolshevism and  continued their war even though WW1 had ended. Then theres also the split answer where they didnt want Russia to be communist / socialist cause that might mean losing a trade partner and former ""anti-german"" ally. Anyone have an idea?

ps. With Allies I'm particularly interested in the US,UK and France

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I formulated my conclusion I would appreciate any and as much feedback as possible on it.

 

""I believe the allied intervention was a quest out of self-interest. Despite some historians believing in the notion that the allies were engaging in an ideological fight against Bolshevism on the basis that the intervention persisted past the first world war delegitimizing the original justifications given for the intervention. As such they believe the allies lingered in Russia until 1920 so that the Bolsheviks had to concentrate on the internal struggle and could not support the revolutionary waves of socialist and communist uprisings such as the ones in german,hungary and italy or even further exacerbate the first red scare in the US, therefore following a policy of containment. 

I however cant fully agree with this thesis while it would be naive to assume the allies wouldnt have rather seen russia stay a liberal-capitalist society and how they did possess a certain degree of disdain for the bolsheviks and their ideology which saw them denounce all Tsarist foreign debts and would nationalize industries the allies had invested in. Had the allies really wanted to engage in an ideological fight against bolshevism they would invested much more into the intervention,not have deployed their theaters of operation far removed from the Bolshevik-controlled heartland,and have striked in 1919 when the whites had the most probable chance of winning. Furthermore the allies would not have arranged the deceleration of truce among the different contending factions in early 1919. With Lloyd George stating he was ready to deal with the bolsheviks as the de facto government and “the one thing to spread bolshevism was to try and suppress “.  Therefore I believe there was never anything resembling ""imperialist intervention"" in the sense of a concerted, purposeful drive of the Western powers to crush the Communist regime and that the intervention was rather rooted in strategic considerations of beating the central powers in world war 1,recouping otherwise lost investments in which a  incidental defeat of the bolsheviks would have been the cherry on top.""","Was the allied intervention in the Russian civil war a quest out of self-interest (economic,strategic,etc. advantages) or a ideological fight against Bolshevism ?"
130,history,"Reading about Napoleonic Wars i always wondered why Napoleon was so soft toward Austria.

Its completely opposite then what he did to Prussia who he almost dismembered 1806 or what he did to Spain. He defeated them in 1790s and in the end given them Venice, 1805 after Austerlitz he again did nothing and 1809 after Wagram he did take Dalmatia and North Italian possessions but still left them as Great Power and even married Austrian Emperor daughter. What i'm really interested is why he simply didn't dismembered Empire, toppled Habsburg and gave independence to Bohemia, Hungary, Croatia and other parts like he did with Poland and turned them into his loyal allies?

So, if the dogs from Europe and the Americas had the same ancestor as the Native American dog breeds, why didn’t the Natives have a comparable war dog breed to the Spanish?  If they did not (which I would suspect to be the case, but I do not know), why not?  The dog breeds shared the same common ancestor and it has been verified to be in the Americas for nearly 10,000 years.

Despite intense opposition, Winston Churchill personally gave Stirling permission to recruit the toughest, brightest and most ruthless soldiers he could find. So began the most celebrated and mysteriousmilitary organization in the world: the SAS.

* **University College Dublin - History &amp; Politics** in my country's #2 university, however it is by a long shot, never made top 100 etc. It is an extremely modern campus further away (less library time etc), more of an engineering/agricultural university, however, the whole idea that political science is possible here makes me wonder should I go here instead and give up on an amazing time at the other university.

244,history,"Franco didn't like the idea of the Republic and I've never been able to find anything concrete as to why he disliked the democratic aspects of it. His beliefs surrounding communism were pretty clear and he stated them in the years leading up to the Spanish Civil War. During the strikes in 1934 in which workers, communists, and anarchist led uprisings across Madrid, Barcelona, and Asturias, he once said ""la revolución había sido concienzudamente preparada por agentes de Moscú""(The revolution had been consciously prepared by agents of Moscow). He also continued to make such statements after WWII since he viewed the Civil War as a victory against communism and used that to build an alliance with the West when he realized that he no longer had fascists allies for support and needed legitimacy.

Where did his beliefs for being anti-democracy come from? Why did he react so strongly to the idea of the Republic? He was pretty young during the 30s. He played politics with king Alfonson to help him get his general position when his associates were much older. Why was he not open to the idea of democracy like other young people were?

My second question has to with the autonomous arrangments that the Republic was preparing on the eve of the war. These arrangements, which are somewhat captured in how Spain is currently structured today, set up Spain in a federal way. These arrangments were aimed at regions of Spain that were not originally part of Castille. Particularly to the Basque Country and Catalonia who sided with the absolutists Carlists in the previous century in exchange for their foral rights. The forals(similiar to charters) had been used to help promote colonization across the peninsula following the Reconquests. When Castille began consolidating in the previous centuries, it eliminated these foral rights apart from a few regions.

During the Second Republic, these agreements were being made for the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia. Andalucia was also in the process of making one. My question is why did Galicia and Andalucia follow suit? From what I've read, although Galicia had been a kingdom before eventually becoming a part of León and Castille, it had been pretty much on the sidelines for much of the countries history and pretty poor. The regional language, Galician, was seen as the language of fishermen and peasants. Galician noblemen had been replaced by those from Castille during the medieval period which elevated the language of Castille in the local courts. To my knowledge, Galician institutions didn't continue to exist as they were integrated into the Castillian court. The same for Andalusia minus the local language since it didn't have one and it had been repopulated following the Reconquest. Compared to Galicia, it had been much more important and was wealthier at one point in the countries history.

246,history,"Or secondary school here in UK, or equivalent in your country? Essentially, what do you spend the last 3-5 years teaching kids about history, most of whom will never study it at higher level? 

The recent thread about teaching ancient history made me wonder what people think the purpose is. For instance, I reckon it's some combination of

1. Equipping someone with a basic frame of historical reference so that when they hear claims/statements about history in the future they can place them in some context \[in my experience, this is a bit of a weakness in UK due to move away from timelines/narrative in favour of a series of spotlights\]

2. As above but more specifically history as it's relevant to where we are *now*. So understanding historical basis behind our political systems, economies etc. with a particular emphasis on the country being taught about (this one is inevitably quite tough as it's vulnerable to major ideological battles over the correct interpretation of these things)

3. Teach some awareness/aptitude in historical method: different sorts of sources, limits on what we know etc. Useful for history and more widely

4. Give kids the opportunity to have their interest sparked in history (which is partially ability of teacher, but I think also suggests you want to focus in on some varied things as different  kids will be inspired by different aspects)

Having written this I've looked up the English [national curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study) and it's a reasonably good match (recent reforms I think brought back in more narrative history). The main thing that leaps out at me is that I'm not sure if you can teach about the histories of 'these islands' without wider reference. For instance, I think any teaching of history that left out the French Revolution or the rise of Communism and the Cold War would fail to meet the requirements above. Similarly I'm not sure if that history is understood to include the impact of the British Empire and its dissolution (though this is flagged as the sort of thing that *could* be included, and I recognise it's quite hard to teach as its interpretation is quite ideologically weighted).",What should high school history teaching cover/achieve?

I mean I know a tiny bit about American submarines in the war, and how they basically did the same thing as the U-Boats, taking out Japanese merchant vessels as well as their warships but all the knowledge I have is very vague. In fact the most specific thing I know about American submarines is that for the first year or two when they were fighting they were fighting with a defective torpedo that would fail to explode way more than one would expect.

and that is a lot compared to what I know of the British submarines, which is essentially nothing. I once recall reading that a British submarine managed to destroy a German submarine underwater, and it being the only time it happened in the war, but that is all I know. I don't know how many British subs there were, or what they really did during the war.

After the Dirty War inside the country was over, Videla and Galtieri (and Chile’s Pinochet) assisted US backed right ring wing militias in both overthrowing left-leaning governments and finding/killing suspected communists all over S America. So in a way, Argentina (&amp; Chile) sort of ran shit down there and pretty much controlled the entire continent. If Argentina was acting like an empire, well that’s because the US essentially made Argentina into a regional “empire” and got them to think that way.

In all likelihood, a British victory would be the end of the military regime, and a likely end for Argentine support of anti-communist terrorist militias across the continent. I’m surprised Britain showed up the USA and the CIA by going to war with Galtieri, although I am aware that the US dropped support for Galtieri when he invaded the Falklands. I thought the Brits would basically look at the Americans with dismay saying “this loss is on YOU” but not actually do anything about it.

The Cold War was still raging at this time so I figured the CIA would have wanted to keep Galtieri in power at any cost. And I figured as a partner of the CIA, MI-6 would have told Thatcher “look Galtieri is a nut job, our diplomats won’t recognize the annexation but we need him in power while the Cold War continues, so no invasions” and stopped Thatcher’s invasion full stop.

Could MI-6 have stepped in and said “hey, we know this is our territory but the CIA wants to keep Galtieri’s people happy, so we just have to let them have this one.”? I know it would have been unacceptable politically for Thatcher but MI-6 and the CIA don’t exist to help or hurt certain politicians ",Could MI-6 have told Thatcher “no” on the Falklands invasion due to the CIA’s support for Operation Condor?

It's mostly based on what people have told me and what I've been unable to confirm through research but I've heard that  there was a difference between the Norman invaders and the Anglo-Saxons in terms of their views/relationship with the church.

329,history,"Much contentious debate has been made in recent revisionist History arguing that Stalinism is the extreme perversion of Leninism caused by Stalin's ""Bonapartist"" approach to governance. But should we view Stalin's policies as continuation and amendment of Lenin's work or as a deliberate break away due to his lust for power? 

&amp;#x200B;

But for a moment, can we not assume that the Stalinist policies of the mid-1930s are simply Stalin's adaptations to the challenges the state faced during that period?  


\- The great terror for example, was the unhinged use of the states monopoly of power, but the methodology for the purges was largely developed during the Russian civil war, which at the time was largely supported by Stalin  


\- Stalin's shift towards ""communism in one country"" instead of a global ongoing revolution can be seen as an adaptation to the fact that Lenin's predictions of a domino effect of socialist uprisings in Europe did not come into play. In fact, in Lenin's last testament he expressed the willingness to forge the global goals in favour of stabilising the domestic situation.   


\- Stalin's economic policy following Lenin's NEP, again could be seen as simply a necessary step to avoid the empowerment of a new capitalist class and a necessary deviation in order to accelerate collectivisation and industrialisation.   


On the other hand of course we can argue that Stalin labeled much of his policies as ""continuations"" of Lenin's work simply to gain legitimacy. But couldn't it be argued regardless that the very policies Lenin implemented in the 1920s and during the civil war simply shaped the way for Stalin's policies?

It was a practical solution to a problem that many people were looking for a solution to. (I'm not a historian on the light bulb, so if you feel i have some details off let me know).

**penicillin** Is something that we discovered almost entirely on accident. Alexander fleming had a lab so messy, mold was growing on his petri dishes.

But i guess that was exactly what i did.""

Its interesting to me that we stumbled across antibiotics like that, after slowly accumulating evidence that bacteria existed and caused infections, with germ theory beginning to be accepted by louis pasteur in the 1860's, with more evidence being found and experiments being conducted by robert koch in the following decades. Koch spent years of his life trying to find a vaccine for tuberculosis, where Fleming got lucky out of the blue.

I have been studying the most populated cities of Holy Roman Empire and was astonished to read that in the 11th century Rome came third with the population of 40-50 thousand inhabitants. I remember that at school we were told that Rome was the most populated city with nearly a million people living there during the first two centuries AD. 

Trying to find out the reason behind such decline in the numbers and historical demographics of Rome, I searched the web, however I found accurate data only since 1861 (195000 people). In the wikipedia article it was said that the estimates about demographics of the city varied from 200 thousand to 2 million according to different studies. 

My first guess was the sackings of 5th century caused the decline. If I am correct, were most of the people slaughtered by the barbarians or did they become refugees and where could they possibly move?",What was the population of Ancient Rome?

461,history,"Background: So I’m currently enrolled at the flagship university in my state. I will graduate this May with my bachelors degree in history. I am in a class that covers the age of the Founding Fathers of America with a special emphasis on Thomas Jefferson. My professor is actually one of the most famous scholars on Jefferson and it is truly a pleasure taking his class. Today we were discussing Jefferson’s relationship with his slave Sally Hemmings. For you that don’t know, the question of whether Jefferson engaged in a relationship with Hemmings was contested in American History until the late 90’s where Jefferson’s DNA was found in several African Americans and matched Jefferson’s lineage from his wife, Patty Jefferson. So it is now widely accepted that Jefferson had a relationship with her. 

My problem: During the lecture, my professor would use many euphemisms to describe the relationship: “he had his way with her,” “they engaged in sexual relations,” “he fancied her,” etc.
I asked him why we didn’t call this rape? My professor responded that we didn’t know if it was rape or not, as we do not know the feelings involved, just that the results were the children. 
I let the issue drop during class but afterwards I approached him and restarted the discussion.
My point is that to describe Jefferson’s relationship (and by extension any other relations that existed between slave masters and slaves, or even between unequals) as anything other than rape is simply untrue. There was no way Hemmings could consent to Jefferson because she was his property; even if she did have some romantic feelings for him could they ever have been divorced from the reality of her enslavement? What if she wasn’t feeling the sex that day, could she have refused Jefferson? 
My professor said that he understood where I was coming from but by labeling Jefferson a rapist, that it closed the conversation and ignored the complexities (Hemmings was actually the half sister of Jefferson’s late wife and her family may have had a privileged status at Monticello). We should perhaps say that Hemmings lacked consent. 
While I agree that the use of the word rape may appear provocative, I cannot in consciousness describe the occasion in any other fashion. And I am not doing so to “pick” on Jefferson (many, many men engaged in similar behavior all throughout history), but rather to argue that the rhetoric we use to describe history matters.
We should be able to say that Jefferson raped Sally Hemmings and continue the conversation. To use euphemisms is to distort history, no matter how provocative or painful it may be to admit. ",Did Thomas Jefferson rape Sally Hemmings? Does it matter? I believe it does.

470,history,"Our species, Homo sapiens, first appeared in approximately 315,000 years ago, started showing “evidence of modernity” 50,000 years ago, and developed the first known civilization in Mesopotamia about 7500 years ago. 

If these humans are anatomically, genetically, and intellectually identical to modern humans, why would it take them over 300,000 years to develop a civilization? Especially in the context of how far we’ve advanced since the Sumerians in just 7500 years. 

Is the process really THAT slow? Or do you think that there may have been civilizations that developed before Sumeria, but we just don’t have any concrete evidence of them quite yet? 

EDIT: Quite a few people have been bringing up Gobekli Tepe, which I think is a very good example of how there were civilizations that predate the Sumerians.

*Historians have compared Frederick to Henry II of England.* ***Both were considered the greatest and most charismatic leaders of their age.*** *Each possessed a rare combination of qualities that made him appear superhuman to his contemporaries: longevity, boundless ambition, extraordinary organizing skill, and greatness on the battlefield. Both were handsome and proficient in courtly skills, without appearing effeminate or affected. Both came to the throne in the prime of manhood. Each had an element of learning, without being considered impractical intellectuals but rather more inclined to practicality. Each found himself in the possession of new legal institutions that were put to creative use in governing. Both Henry and Frederick were viewed to be sufficiently and formally devout to the teachings of the Church, without being moved to the extremes of spirituality seen in the great saints of the 12th century. In making final decisions, each relied solely upon his own judgment,\[84\] and both were interested in gathering as much power as they could.*   


But on his own wiki it says:  


*Henry was not a popular king and few expressed much grief on news of his death.\[355\] Writing in the 1190s, William of Newburgh commented that ""****in his own time he was hated by almost everyone****""; he was widely criticised by his own contemporaries, even within his own court.*

522,history,"I don't know all the ins and outs about the anti-communist revolutions of 1989. I'm a political science major, so I have a good handle on basics. The Romanian regime was one of the most repressive of the Soviet bloc, with a crushing secret police and other typical totalitarian characteristics. Nicolae Ceausescu, the country's dictator, had completely mismanaged the economy, making it extremely poor/hard for people to survive. But yesterday, I saw some of the videos from those final days and it gave me chills. 

There's one video of a staged rally organized by the Labor Party in Bucharest to show support for Ceausescu. This was right after he had ordered soldiers to fire on peaceful protesters a few days before in another part of the country, resulting in the deaths of 17 people. But the workers were forced to come to this rally and stand in the cold for hours, probably so frustrated. You can see all of them there in the bewildering numbers that communist totalitarian regimes put together, like in North Korea today. Then, you see Ceausescu giving his speech, thanking the organizers of the rally. He calls it ""this great popular meeting in Bucharest"".

That's when the crowd collectively lose their sh\*t, and start jeering and shouting at Ceausescu. They're done with the lies and the BS. But as you hear the noise swell, all you can see is Ceausescu, a little old man by himself at a podium, raising his hand to try to calm them down. He looks completely taken aback. As the shouts of the crowd get louder and louder the feed cuts off, as the broadcasters realized how bad this made them look to Romanians at home.

As a person who cares about human rights, but also as a student of political science, this short video is fascinating to me in a few ways. It makes me think about two sides of this: what is going through the minds of the people, and what is going through the mind of Ceausescu at that moment. Buckle up, because this is about to get a bit nerdy. I'm going to talk about a couple of theories on authoritarian regimes, and how they can help us understand this event.

In his book, The Politics of Uncertainty, Andreas Schedler talks about the ironic weakness of totalitarian regimes: the performative behavior of everyone inside it. This includes the people, the elites, and the dictator himself. When you have a state like Romania with extremely extensive surveillance and secret police, everyone is paranoid and everyone is forced to ACT like they're loyal to the regime. At first, this is good for the dictator, as it becomes difficult for defectors to connect with each other, based on the fact that everyone has to act like they love the regime. If you don't, there's the huge risk that someone who hears you will sell you out. This disrupts any resistance efforts really well. But ironically, this eventually becomes a weakness, as the dictator and his elite circle are unable to gauge exactly how much dissent there really is, since everybody is basically lying to you through their teeth at any moment. I think this explains the bewilderment we see on Ceausescu's face when the crowd starts jeering at him. Obviously, he had to know that SOME people didn't like him. There was that protest a few days before. But I bet he had no idea about the extent to which people hated him until it was right in his face. He had started to believe the lie he created, that he was loved by the Romanian people. On the other hand, I bet the crowd was just as surprised by themselves as Ceausescu was in them. It must have been such a powerful moment - you're standing there in the cold, at a rally you don't even want to be at for a leader who has destroyed your country. Maybe you get so fed up you shout something without thinking about it. Before you know it, the whole area around you is filled with sound as you realize you're not alone.

In Timur Kuran's piece called ""Now Out of Never"", he specifically talked about the 1989 revolutions, and how they took everyone involved by surprised. Kuran has this theory of ""revolutionary thresholds"", basically how many people have to be in the streets before you as an individual go out too. Some people will go out and protest alone, they're that ballsy. But most aren't like that. They need to see that there's a certain number of people out there before they feel comfortable about doing it too, basically like a cost-benefit analysis. Going back to why the people started shouting at the rally. These were workers who knew the consequences of openly showing dissent. At first, probably one or two people said something. That gave more people confidence to participate, then more and more like a snowball effect, and then in a few moments the revolution is underway.

Anyway, I just think it's so fascinating. The video is a 4:29 brief overview you can easily find on YouTube. Be warned, there are some disturbing images in it. If you have any interesting knowledge about the 1989 revolutions in general, I'd love to hear it!",The Romanian Revolution of 1989 gives me chills

Why Vietnam would want to keep secret prisoners that are therefore useless as bargaining chips is unclear to me.

This issue had massive political consequences, was taken seriously by huge sections of the population (the second Rambo movie was all about this), and impeded America's relationship with Vietnam for years. Even after countless investigations and searches by Vietnam veterans, both official and unofficial, found no evidence that a single American was left behind, peopler still latch on to this narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a fan of the AlternateHistoryHub channal and the entertaining videos that come out of it, however the most recent video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLiI6kXZkZI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=46&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLiI6kXZkZI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=46&amp;t=0s), is what I believe to be a prime example of bad history. Now I'm certainly not an expert and I have never written in this sub before, but this video has stirred something of a firestorm in my mind due to its wide assumptions on what people should've done and how history would've played out differently had \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happened, which was enough to motivate myself to write about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now one thing I have noticed about contemporary discussions on history is that people like to blame our misery on specific people or events from the past, and this video seems to lay the Big Kahuna that was the misery of the 20th century on the shoulder's of Woodrow Wilson; outright stating that he was the worst president ever. How does the video justify this opinion? Mainly with two arguments: Joining WW1 late and Wilson's desire to ""Spread Democracy."" These are points that deserve much scrutiny so I'll break down both.

Out of the two arguments this one atleast has the most merit, but even then it is extremely flawed. While it is obvious that the first world war would've ended sooner had the U.S. joined the war a year or two earlier, that arugment relies heavily on the ""had"" part of that sentence. The video makes the assumption that if Teddy Roosevelt was elected president in 1912 instead of Woodrow Wilson, the U.S. mighted entered the war in 1915 instead. Now this just seems ridiculous to me, I mean how would the people of the U.S. agree to such a thing? The vast majority of the population was against joining following the first couple of years of the war breaking out, and even then many people in the U.S. that were pro war wanted to join GERMANY'S side and not the entente's. In addition just look at when the European powers decided to intervene: Britain joined only after Germany violated Belgium's neutrality, Italy and Blugraria joined in 1915, Romania and Portugal in 1916, and Greece in 1917. These were all nations that were in the middle of the action and had way more reason to join the conflict but still took their time, yet somehow Roosevelt was going to slap two dicks together and make the U.S. join in 1915? This is a nation that still largely view itself as detached from European affairs and hadn't engaged in major conflicts outside of the Americas. The people weren't about to join the war early due to the sinking of a single cruise liner that just happened to carry Americans. It just seems like a far fetched fantasy, and if it actually occured would've most likely resulted in Teddy getting the boot in the 1916 elections as soon as hundreds of thousands of American coffins started coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

Even then, so what if the U.S. had joined the war early? The video implies that if Germany was defeated a year or two earlier (which is optimistic) then there wouldn't have been a rise of facism or a Bolshevik revolution (assuming that the revolution doesn't occur anyways)? Well one can just as easily make the point that had the allies done more to intervene in the Russian civil war the whites could've won preventing the rise of the Soviet Union, or had the allies not been so harsh on Gemany in Versailles and ironically had listened more to Wilson then Hitler wouldn't have risen to power, etc. And even if there is no USSR or Nazi Germany, that doesn't mean that other tradegies wouldn't have followed. One can spend all day imagining different scenarios playing out such as a war between the west and the hegemonic Russian empire or a falling out of relations between Britain and France, etc. The point is that a WW1 that ends sooner does not necessarily bring the world down a more peaceful path.

&amp;#x200B;

Wilson's ideas on ""Spreading Democracy"" and American Interventionism.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this argument is just a really bad one. The video seems to make the point that Wilson's biggest mistake was starting the legacy of Wilsonian Intervensionism. America was already an interventionist power well before Wilson, such as establishing trade relations in Asia, expanding imperially in the Phillipines, the Pacific, and Carribeans, and engaging in ""local affairs"" in Latin America. The main difference with Wilson's ideology was that he wanted to intervene and stay in the name of spreading American democracy around the world and not just for business or territorial gain ( not that this always worked out perfectly ). He argued at Versailles for national determination and was vehemently against strictly punishing Germany for the war, opposing what France wanted. The failure to listen to Wilson created a shitty hybrid compromise where Germany was punshied enough to instill nationalist zeal and hatred but not enough to prevent German rearmament (although granted the unwillingness of the allies to resist Hitler until it was too late also didn't help). That and the eventually republican withdrawal from the league of nations, was very much a significant contributor to the downward spiral that led to the second world war. The video also seems to argue that if we had followed Roosevelt's ""big stick diplomacy,"" or the ""get in, get out"" approach; the U.S. would've been better off, using the Gulf War as an example. This again doesn't invalidate the Wilsonian approach however. While the ""big stick"" method works well in a situation like the gulf war where the goal wasn't to spread democracy but to prevent Iraq from threatening it, It would've failed in other conflicts. The Wilsonian approach worked well in Europe and Japan following WW2, as well as Korea, since it was crucial that the U.S. remained in those nations to insure that Democracy would take hold so that they do not succumb to Communist influence and remained allies.

&amp;#x200B;

We are very much blinded by our interventionist failures in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Africa to see what good American Intervention has brought to the world. Those failures were not brought on by the Wilsonian apporach, but by the fact that no proper apporach was used at all. Either way for every failure of American intervention, there are at least half a dozen success stories. Today 3/4 of the planet's nations are democracies, compared to less than a quarter at the time of Wilson. Most of these democracies are allied to the U.S., and nowhere in the world are there major conflicts going on because of this. We live in the most peaceful times there have ever been and the average human's level of wealth and freedom is at it's peak. This is undeniably a result of American influence, and a lot of it stems from Wilson and his 14 points, however flawed a man he was.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, I know this is maybe not the best written essay but I'm not exactly an experienced writer, I'm just trying to convey my thoughts and feelings about AlternateHistoryHub's video. It just seems unfair that Wilson is taking so much shit in the video and is talked about like he's the devil himself. Of course, he was still an extremely flawed figure, and his views on racism are rather disgusting and leave much to be desired. That doesn't mean that he was a horrible person, and it frankly is childish to just blame him for our current problems today. The fact is that with or without him there still would be racism, we still would've had horrible wars, and we still would be stuck in crappy conflicts. Either way one can say he's responsible for much good in the world just as easily as one can blame him for our misery.

&amp;#x200B;

History does not revolve around single individuals who are solely responsible for our woes, it is a chaotic mess of randomness that doesn't follow a logical path. Judging people by the events that transpired decades following their decisions is foolish, because people act in the way they think is best at the time of making their decisions and do not have control over random events that might taint their legacy in the future. They do not have the benefit of hindsight like we do. Afterall, when Bush and Obama decided to intervene in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Lybia, there weren't thinking ""Damn, Woodrow Wilson made me do this,"" they were acting on their own decisions, and it is up to the people of the present to correct the present's mistakes. Afterall, blaming the problems of today on the people of the past merely gives us a comfortable excuse to not correct the problems ourselves, which only prolongs our misery.

552,history,"Who was by antiquity's standards the most outstanding human being during the adult life of Jesus Christ? In retrospective, Jesus is the most influential human being in history, but during his own lifetime, he was the founder of a relatively small religious group. Men of science probably weren't  as unanimously revered as now days, and it wasn't a time of great discoveries either way. So it was most likely a ruler/military leader.

Let's say between the deaths of brave millitary leader **Arminius&amp;Germanicus**(19-21AD for the former) and the rise of **Emperor Guangwu of Han**(ascended to the throne in 25AD so probably a few years till he gained respect of his poeple).

\-The Roman Emperor was **Tiberius**, and while he was successful as a general, he was rated as a poor Emperor after the death of his son.

\-there are 2 contemporary **Chinese emperors** during this time(so not enough to fill the gap) and the latter was an incompetent ruler

\-**Sejanus** was arguably the most influential man in the Roman Empire for a while, but he was as unsavory as Tiberius

\-The Parthian king **Artabanus** was a cruel king and there's hardly anything outstanding about him.

\-In India, the **Kushan king** was relatively average.

&amp;#x200B;

So all the usual suspects are essentially cut out. The best I could find was the Dacian ruler,  **Comosicus** .

*Jordanes refers to* [*Burebista*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burebista) *as king of* [*Dacia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia)*, but then goes on to discuss a high priest called* [*Dicineus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicineus) *who taught the Dacians astronomy and whose wisdom was revered. He then says that ""after the death of Dicienus, they held Comosicus in almost equal honour, because he was not inferior in knowledge. By reason of his wisdom he was accounted their priest and king, and he judged the people with the greatest uprightness.""*  Sounds like the most intelligent monarch of his age.

553,history,"I've noticed that:

* When the Roman Empire was around, an extremely large state was able to exist
* After the Western Roman Empire fell, Western European realms fractured into small chiefdoms (the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate are a different story)
* As Feudalism rose in the 700s, large realms started to exist again (e.g. Holy Roman Empire), and small chiefdoms elsewhere started to coalesce into larger nations (e.g. the Heptarchy)
* By the 900s, somewhat large states existed again, such as England, Norway, Denmark, France, Castile, Leon, Galicia, Hungary, Poland and the Kievan Rus.

This inspires to ask the following questions:

* Why were the Romans able to run an extremely large state, but the Western Europeans couldn't until the Age of Colonialism? Did Western Europe somehow lose knowledge on running extremely large states?
* What made it so that Western Europeans were stuck in tiny chiefdoms when the Western Roman Empire fell? Why didn't Western Roman Empire collapse into Francia, Italia, Hispania and Britannia?

555,history,"One that springs to mind for me, was Operation Mincemeat in WWII. Such a risky, crazy mission to float the dead body of a vagrant named Glyndwr Michael onto Spanish shores disguised as a high ranking British officer named Captain (Acting Major) William Martin in the hope that the body finds its way to the shore intact, carrying 'British secret plans for Invasion of Sardinia and Greece'. And is somehow found by a high ranking German officer...

So much could have gone wrong. The body was already beginning to decay when thrown into the water. 

The tides were uncertain. 

The autopsy would almost certainly have revealed the corpse being older than was needed to provide the bluff, thankfully an insider at the autopsy tried to hide this by saying something along the lines of, ""let's just hurry this and go get lunch, it's too hot"". So the autopsy was ruled as drowning, which furthered the bluff (rather than eating rat poison, which is how Glyndwr Michael actually died).

On top of all of this was some serious back and forth bluffs and double bluffs via spies, deliberately crackable and breakable messages.

Major Martin's 'death at sea via planecrash' was even reported by The Times, and coincidentally his death was placed amidst two other (real) Officers who had died at sea, further enhancing the bluff.

Somehow against all odds, it worked. Hitler was convinced and changed his tactics. Shuffled and rotated his military hardware and troops accordingly.

--

On an amusing note, I remember fondly reading about something that happened in Africa(?) not too long after the deception had been revealed as a bluff and D-Day occurred.

I think I remember reading about some British Officer somehow accidentally leaving some extremely important documents, which were then obtained by a high ranking German Officer. However this time, those offensive plans were considered bluffs and thus the Germans refused to be 'fooled' twice, and ignored the documents as nothing more than lies.

Almost a reverse Operation Mincemeat.

600,history,"Tl;Dr: Basically the title. Periods in history with several nation-states in close proximity that were in competition while being relatively equally matched (no empires or hegemons).

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone, I'm a political scientist working on some research, and I thought I'd reach out to Reddit's historian community because I'm not always as versed in history as I should be. Furthermore my field of study emphasizes certain eras and government systems which can blind me to some more niche areas of history. Btw please inform me if this question does not meet the rules of the subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for any era and place in history where the international relations of the region are marked by multiple very close (preferably territorial tangent) nation-states that are in constant competition, either in the form of war or a general balance of power arrangement (which can include economic competition).

&amp;#x200B;

By ""nation"" and ""state"" I am using the political science definitions, which are probably basically the same for historians.

&amp;#x200B;

By ""state"" I mean a ""a political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly by use of force within a certain geographical territory."" More specifically it is the institutions and machinery of governance; a centralized system of government with a clear authority (monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, etc) that can determine policy (from multiple different options) for the state as a whole, and some form of system beneath that deciding body (often in the form of a bureaucracy) that can implement those policies in some form. In addition some form of regularized military is also required for the definition I am using.

&amp;#x200B;

By ""nation"" I mean ""a distinct population of people that are bound together by a common culture, history, and tradition who are typically concentrated within a specific geographic region.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I am looking for periods where there are multiple nation-states (not one nation that has collapsed into many separate states that still share a roughly identical culture and who eventual reform into one nation) in close proximity and in constant tension or outright conflict. In addition, they should be of roughly equal strength - I am not looking for a vast empire surrounded by smaller tributary polities (like ancient China and most of the nearby nations, or the Roman Empire). The various nation-states must be able to compete with each other effectively, without being dominated by one giant hegemon.

&amp;#x200B;

One example might be western Europe for a lot of its post-Roman history, especially starting around the time of religious wars through the peace of Westphalia, leading into the age of colonization and all the way until the end of the world wars. Another might be ancient Greece and the competition by the various unique city-states such as Athens and Sparta (they don't need to be countries by the modern definition, but rather unique polities with both a state and a nation).

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. I'm looking for other examples of this situation. Colleagues have suggested the Balkans or parts of India as examples, without much context. Do you, the historians of reddit, know of any other such historical periods?


Edit:
I realize that my definition was way too vague to be useful. As I mentioned in the comments, ""it doesn't mean they have to all be entirely separate cultures with no crossover in culture or history. They can be similar, or share a historical past together. What I am looking for in particular though is that they do not internally identify themselves as part of a greater whole with their competing neighbors, such as the various ""Germanic"" nations that considered themselves to be related. I'm looking for full competition with the goal being unrelated to any potential cultural ties that might dampen the intensity of that competition and unmoored from any desires to merge to a larger conglomeration due to the perception that they are parts of a whole.""",What historical periods and geographical eras were defined by close proximity and constant conflict or tensions between multiple independent nation-states?

642,history,"The Greek Civil War is considered by many historians the first cold war proxy war. 

Fighting was between the [Democratic Army of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Army_of_Greece) (**DSE**) which was the military branch of the [Communist Party of Greece (KKE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Greece), supported by neighboring newly founded Socialist States of Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria, and the [Greek government army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Army) — backed by the United Kingdom and the United States. 

The war lasted until 1949 and was ultimately won by the government army, while the remaining forces of DSE had to leave the country. The defeat of the soviet-backed communist forces was presented as a victory of the West versus the East. In this narrative US and British support saved Greece from communism. 

The problem with this narrative is that in the Moscow Conference (October 1944) Stalin and Churchill agreed (the Percentages Agreement) that Greece would belong to the British sphere of influence. This was one of the matters that caused friction between Tito and Stalin since Tito was openly supportive of the communist side in the [Greek Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War), while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with [Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) not to support communism there with the [Percentages agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentages_agreement). 

Apparently Tito supported the Greek communists as part of a greater plan to incorporate Albania and parts of Greece in cooperation with [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria), thereby creating a large Balkan Slavic communist state outside of Moscow's control. 

Apparently Stalin did not see Tito's ambitions in a positive light.

The friction culminated in 1948 when Stalin stated his unqualified opposition to the ""Greek uprising"". Stalin explained to the Yugoslav delegation that the situation in Greece was different from the one in Yugoslavia because the US and Britain would ""never permit \[Greece\] to break off their lines of communication in the Mediterranean"". (Stalin used the word *svernut*, Russian for ""fold up"", to express what the Greek Communists should do.)

The Tito–Stalin split directly influenced the military outcome of the Greek Civil War since the DSE used bases and camps in Yugoslavia and was dependent on supplies and equipment from Yugoslavia, plus the advantage of being able to retreat across the border in order to regroup and resupply in areas where the government army could not pursue.  

Since Yugoslavia had been the Greek Communists' main supporter, the KKE was forced to choose between its loyalty to the Soviet Union and its relations with its closest ally. After much internal conflict, the great majority, led by party secretary [Nikolaos Zachariadis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaos_Zachariadis), chose to follow the Soviet Union. 

 With that decision the leaders of KKE essentially doomed their cause since they sided with Stalin who was never supportive of their cause against Tito who was the main supporter of their cause.   In response to the above decision Tito closed the Yugoslav border to the DSE in July 1949 and disbanded the camps inside Yugoslavia. The DSE was only able to use Albanian border territories, a very poor alternative. Within the Greek Communist Party, the split with Tito also sparked a witch hunt for ""Titoites"" that demoralized and disorganized the ranks of the DSE and sapped support for the KKE in urban areas.

 In August 1949, the government army launched a major offensive against DSE forces in northern Greece, codenamed ""Operation Torch"". The campaign was a victory for the government army and resulted in heavy losses for the DSE. The DSE army was thus no longer able to sustain resistance in pitched battles. By September 1949, the main body of DSE divisions defending Grammos and Vitsi, the two key positions in northern Greece for the DSE, had retreated to Albania effectively ending the Greek Civil War. 

Based on the above information the argument can be made that infarct the Greek Communists acted less as a projection of Stalin's wishes to contest the status quo in Greece, and more as a vessel of Tito's ambitions to expand Yugoslavia into Greek territories.

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read.

Athens and its allies were also fighting on and off with them for over 50 years. They certainly had strong and shrewd leaders like Pericles over the years. Surely one or two leaders prior to 371 would have realize that Sparta was probably doing something different from them that resulted in these victories.

This subreddit apparently has a minimum character limit for self posts, so to fulfill that requirement, here's some basic info about Villon.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

""Mais où sont les neiges d'antan?"" 

This is the most famous and well known quote from [François Villon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/François_Villon#Biography), a medieval French poet known as much for his roguish exploits as for his poetry. 

Born in 1431 as either François de Montcorbier or François de Loges, he studied at the University of Paris as a young man. Later, in 1455, he was banished for fatally stabbing a priest to death in a street fight. (Allegedly, the priest started it.)

Later on, after a stay in prison, he stabbed another person in another street fight. He was banished again. Not much is known of his life after this second incident.

His poetry reflects his involvement in the ""criminal underworld"" of fifteenth century Paris, incorporating contemporary thieves' slang and other linguistic features that went against the grain of the usual courtly ideals of the time.

668,history,"My brother-in-law is doing research for a book. He wanted to know my ideas on a fairly obscure topic of boats and river travel on the Ohio, Mississippi... in the early 1800s. He can find lots of material on how flat bottom boats were built and sailed down the rivers. But no material on how water was kept out of the boats. He suspected that some sort of pump may have been used or were they bailed by hand (probably almost continuously). If they were pumped how was the pump constructed in the wilderness? Leather was probably used for the piston end, so did people have enough metal on hand for the pump body, or was a branch hollowed out and used? If not pumping then were the boats eventually made water tight enough so that only occasional builging was required? Were assuming that wood buckets were used to bail water out of the boats.

 There are multiple references to ""leather pumps"" as part of a flatboats equipment list in a number of journals written in the late 18th century. These journals stress that most flatboats were built by frontier farmers without access to milled lumber or nails. No metal was used. Pumps of some sort were homemade too, with a leather cup on the plunger. There are plans galore for flatboat construction but nothing to be found on the pumps.  

A huge percentage of farmers built flatboats yearly, floated them to Natchez or New Orleans, sold their crops, and then walked home via the Natchez Trace, until steam boats came on the scene (1811). The boats would be disassembled and sold as lumber…or broken up for firewood. After steamboats, the flatboats would be loaded with firewood (for the steamboat) and towed back upstream.

689,history,"I spent a solid afternoon wikipedia'ng the Surrender of Japan and despite it being interesting reading and providing a very different view of its surrender compared to what I had thought, it also made me think of the differences between the WW2 surrender and post war years of Germany and Japan.

Germany had the whole Nazi party basically ripped out and removed and extensive de-Nazification continued until today, with even the image of Hitler being banned. Germany as a nation is often publically and vocally apologetic about the Holocaust, its role in the deaths of millions and how awful the Nazi ruling party was. Its extensively taught in schools, concentration camps (the few there were in Germany main) are open as museums. (I'm going to gloss over the fact that many members of the Nazi party were left in power both to aid the transition to democracy, provide a bastion vs the USSR and help the allied war/ space efforts).

Compare this to Japan. The ruling party was not removed, the ruling members were replaced or killed themselves, but the Emperor was left untouched. The imperial household never admitted any guilt in the war or the extensive war crimes and of course none of its members were ever charged with war crimes (from what i could see). Hirohito's surrender speech is actually pretty incredible to read. It gives no admission of having ever done anything wrong, blames the allies for the war and its invasion of SEA and claims its surrender is due to purely philanthropic reasons. I know this is a speech of propaganda, but if you examine the history of Japan since, its very consistent with the minimization, ignoring or down-right suppression of its actions in WW2.

I don't think many would be surprised to learn that Japan's actions during WW2 were as, if not more, evil than Germany's. Yet I have seen multiple modern examples of the Japanese government trying to minimise its war crimes, for instance it rejected the fact that there was such a thing as ""Comfort Women"" in Korea, instead saying the basic enslavement of all Korean women to be **used** by its soldiers as them willingly choosing a life of prostitution: [Comfort women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women#cite_note-148). Then theres the [rewriting of Japanese school textbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_history_textbook_controversies) to censor war crimes, the invasion of China and the Japanese armies role in forcing the mass suicides of the citizen population of Okinawa.

699,history,I see no disadvantages to letting them fight weather you were pro or anti black. Even if you were racist wouldn’t sending them off to war get them out of the country temporarily and you know less will come back when it’s over. This would have made less white men get drafted. Speed them through training and give them the oldest gear and you have cannon fodder for the front lines. I could see how drafting them could look like slavery and cause an uproar but letting them volunteer sounds like a good way to keep them complacent. Also if your being racist be racist. As slaves they were bred for strength and endurance so you’d think they’d be better fighters. If you supported them they should have the same right to fight for their country as anyone. Also more volunteers means less drafts which leads to higher civilian morale. Am I missing something? It just doesn’t make sense from either point of view to me.,Why were African-Americans denied military service simply because they were black during segregation?

How would the leaders of a nation deal with this, in those cases? What can it teach us about future events of a similar nature?

711,history,"It seems to me that far too much significance is placed upon the use of horse archers by varying nomadic tribes, especially when compared to shock and cataphract cavalry. To clarify, I do not believe that horse archers were what won battles, and were nowhere near as effective as an organised heavy cavalry unit. A good starting example would be the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC compared to the Romans' wars with the Alans in the 2nd Century. At Carrhae, a combined a combined force of Horse archers **and Cataphracts** were able to rout a larger Roman army. The Horse archers' role in that battle started and ended at harassing the Romans to get them to loosen formations and then allowing the Cataphracts to charge. The Romans could have easily countered the Iranians using a large force of foot archers, who would have been able to repulse the horse archers. That is precisely what Arrian said he did during his wars with the Alans, who had used almost exclusively horse archers, and beat them. Even the Mongols, who are always hailed as having perfected the horse archer, had dedicated at least a third of their force as cataphracts. During Charlemagne's wars, he too was able to achieve massive success against the Avars using his army that primarily consisted of heavy cavalry.  And, as my final example, the battle of Lechfield, where Otto The Great's army, that, again, primarily consisted of  mailed knights, who, aside from a minor skirmish at the Germans' supply train, were able to rout a Hungarian force of primarily horse archers.",Are horse archers overrated?

FINAL ISSUE


S S PAINE WINGATE IS EXPECTED TO DOCK AT NEW YORK PIER ABOUT NOON TOMORROW, COMPLETING 19-DAY VOYAGE FROM MARSEILLE; WEATHER REPORTS NOT FAVORABLE


Dressed in olive drab, complete with overcoats and overseas caps, personnel of the 310th Field Artillery Battalion will walk down the gangplank in New York harbor tomorrow afternoon, thus completing a 19-day trip from Marseille, France, to the United States.

Latest estimates were that the SS Paine Wingate will reach Ambrose Light, outside of New York harbor, at 1000 tomorrow and there will pick up a pilot for the movement into the pier, which is unknown at this time.The trip from Ambrose Light to the pier is expected to take about two hours.

The prognosis on weather indicates a rough voyage from here to the harbor, but not rough enough to seriously impede the progress of the ship. Mileage figures could not be obtained today.

The uniform for debarkation will be wool OD, with combat boots or leggins, overseas caps, overcoats. Ties or blouses are not necessary.

After the Paine Wingate passes Ambrose Light, all duffel bags will be placed on deck in places to be designated. The personnel of the ship will debark in passenger list order--the same which was used for embarkation at Marseille.

After the baggage has been placed on deck, the holds will be policed thoroughly--the bottom bunks being raised to facilitate the cleaning. No equipment will be left behind.

When the Paine Wingate docks, there will be no smoking on the ship or on the pier. No one will go aft of Hold 5, or forward of Hold 1.

PIPELINE PRESS GOES OUT OF BUSINESS; PLACED ON AUCTION BLOCK at 2000 TODAY; NEW YORK CORRESPONDENT’S LIST MESSAGE PRINTED ON THIS ISSUE


	


For Sale:
2 battered typewriters; one slightly used mimeograph machine; full rights to the name “THE PIPELINE PRESS”.
	
There comes a time in every newspaper’s life when it is necessary to discuss the background--for the amusement of the readers and to find something to fill a lot of white space.

Owner, publisher and general manager was Lt. Arthur Charpentier who quickly doubled the staff by adding Sgt Bill Evans to the “payroll” under the title “editor”. The mechanical staff was headed by Sgt Dan Zarnick who cut as many stencils aboard the Paine Wingate as he did with XII Corps.

In its brief but glorious history, THE PIPELINE PRESS had many difficulties--the first was the shortage of stencils which was eliminated after the second day and issues started coming daily. Then there was an ink shortage and the paper went back to an “every other day” schedule--until recently. 

The rest of the staff comprised Tim Gibbons, photographer, whose picture of Bermuda is not published as he pushed off on a second inner tube to get photos of the 310th landing in New York, and our New York correspondent who went with the first advance party. He is G.I. HADIT, of Buffalo. Some of our news as you know was radioed to us from New York by Hadit. It was necessary to decode it as he endeavored to save as many words as possible. To give you a little more about the inside workings of a newspaper, today we print his dispatch from New York in its raw form: PIPELINE PRESS S S PAINE WINGATE ATLANTIC OCEAN ATLANTIC OCEAN STOP COLD SELL HE IN NY STOP CHECKED WITH WAR DEPARTMENT AND LEARNED MEN ABOARD WINGATE MAY GO TO SWANSON(?) OR GREAT LAKES AS THEY NOW ARE ELIGIBLE FOR NAVAL DISCHARGE ALSO STOP LEARNED S S DICKINSON DOCKED HERE TWO WEEKS AGO WITH PERSONNEL WITH POINTS HANGING FROM 21 THROUGH 23 STOP ALL SINCE DISCHARGED STOP RECEIVED MY DISCHARGE WAITING FOR SHIP TO DOCK STOP SOLD CAMERA TO FIVE POINTER ETO BOUND STOP LEAVING FOR BUFFALO TONIGHT ON DOG SLED STOP MERRY CHRISTMAS STOP

Therefore, THE PIPELINE PRESS goes on auction at 2000 today in Hold 1. The auctioneer will be the captain of the head.

310TH TO DOCK AS US SUFFERS FROM WORST COLD SPELL OF WINTER; BUFFALO BURIED UNDER ALMOST FOUR FOOT OF SNOW; MERCURY BELOW ZERO AS FAR SOUTH AS FLORIDA

The United States is in the grip of a terrific cold spell today. Temperatures generally were below normal in a wide area east of the Rockies. The mercury fell below zero in Montana, and the Dakotas eastward through Central Illinois and Indiana. The coldest spot last midnight was Glascow, Montana, where it was 20 below. It’s freezing as far south as the northern end of the Florida Peninsula and along the Gulf Coast of Southern Mississippi. A blizzard from Lake Erie deposited up to 38 inches of snow on Buffalo causing a state of emergency. In sunny Florida, the thermometer has nose dived to 32 degrees, while Providence, Rhode Island is shivering in an 11 degree above zero temperature. Billing(s), Montana--traditionally a cold spot--is really shivering with the temperature down to 20 degrees below zero and still dropping. The following weather forecast picked up this morning by the ship’s radio from New York is published in its entirety:




MONDAY DEC 17 - NEW YORK CITY WEATHER FORECAST - 0730 TEMPERATURE 13 DEGREES - WIND 13 MILES PER HOUR - HIGHEST TEMPERATURE IN NEW YORK CITY TODAY 20 DEGREES - TONIGHT 10 DEGREES IN CITY 5 DEGREES IN SUBURBS - TUESDAY TEMPERATURE ABOUT THE SAME BUT NOT QUITE SO WINDY.
	
The AP reports from Washington that the Pearl Harbor investigation is in the midst of a political flare-up. With today’s session, Rep. Keefe(?) demanded to know whether the Senate House Committee is investigating Pearl Harbor or Governor Dewey. Keefe is referring to previous testimony that General George C. Marshall appealed to Governor Dewey to quiet talk about Pearl Harbor during the 1944 presidential campaign. Another controversy aroused today when Senator Brewster read into the record a statement by Percy L. Reaves, in which he stated that he never intended to insult or reflect in any way on members of the committee. Reaves is a former employee of the Republican National Committee. His presence at the inquiry has evoked caustic remarks from Democratic members.

Meanwhile the red hot controversy over the proposed Army-Navy merger continues before the Senate Military Affairs Committee. After a long series of Navy arguments against unification, General Somerville; head of the ASF, took the stand to give further arguments for the union.

The Army’s new 430 MPH bomber, the Mix Master, which recently set a new coast to coast record, crashed yesterday while on a routine forty minute flight. It was completely demolished. According to the pilot, who bailed out at 400 feet and was considerably shaken by his experience, the motors quit instantly while flying.

Talks started in Moscow between Secretary of State Byrnes, Foreign Minister of Great Britain Bevin, and Foreign Commisar Molotov of Russia. An “atmosphere of cordiality”, unlike the London conference which ended in complete failure, was said to prevail.

ARE WE REALLY GETTING THERE? You bet your life we are. The latest hot dope puts us into New York about noon tomorrow. More convincing than reports, however, was a session we had this morning with a small portable broadcast set Frank Connely, chief radio operator aboard, has in his room. A twirl of the dial produced a honeyed voiced announcer in Providence telling us we ought to swab our chest with Rusteroic(?) to get rid of any damn thing that ails us. A gent in New York promised us eternal youth if we would munch a bushel or two of some breakfast food or other. On short wave, we heard a cop in the big city tell a prowl car to proceed quietly to an apartment uptown to look into some shenanigans there. And then there was the Joe in Boston who was practically in tears because we didn’t have an exide battery in every car. This could only be the United States coming in on the beam(?) but strong. Yes, we’re getting there.

This is the last issue of the PIPELINE PRESS--for which “leave us all give thanks”. In bowing out--or beating a hasty retreat, depending on your point of view--we owe a big vote of thanks to the ship’s master, Capt. L. L. Beasley, for the cooperation he has given us throughout the voyage. We have bothered him about mileage, barged into his chart room, tramped his bridge, asked seven million questions, and never once have received the bum’s rush to which we were entitled. Many thanks also to the ship’s radio gang, Frank Connely, Ronnie Kayerson, and George Mahoney for their help in getting us the news. This last got to the point where they would copy anything interesting that came over, if we didn’t happen to be around at the time. Lt. Wheeler, the official Transportation Corps representative aboard, has given us a great deal of assistance, aided and abetted by his T/3 commando, whose name escapes us for the moment. And so, with the sound of a Christmas Carol in our ears coming over the radio, the PIPELINE PRESS wishes all those friends of ours a Merry Christmas in that most delightful of all our places -- home.

737,history,"One for the experts on military history on here: 

With town walls especially in smaller towns (like Rothenburg, to name one of the more famous examples) being much less sophisticated than those on proper castles, I'm wondering if those fortifications were actually useful against determined military threats or if they were mostly used to keep out troublemakers, sick people and beggars? 

What would point towards a military use is that most town walls do feature loopholes to fire arrows or crossbows through, but as I said before, town walls also seem (naturally, considering their much greater length) to be much less massive and layered than what one would see at actual castles. 

So, I guess the truth is somewhere in the middle, but maybe some of the experts on here know a bit more, e.g. about concrete examples of medieval towns and cities resisting against significant armies.",Military significance of medieval town walls?

739,history,"Hey everyone,

Both of my parents are history professors with multiple PhDs, but I always thought history was boring and dull and full of people making mistakes. 
Until now! I realized that I am more and more passionate about the Romans, especially Republic to Empire time period, so I’ve been reading a lot on it and it’s quite interesting.

So a question I can’t seem to answer is: why is it that the Roman Empire did not expand any further into Africa? I know that they went North and East as much as they could? But why not South? 
I realize that the Saharan desert was a big impediment - but was nobody curious about going up the Nile further into the continent and conquer the tribes?

742,history,"This is sparked by a trivia fact that I've seen many, many trivia pages: 
&gt;In 1912 a law passed in Nebraska where drivers in the country at night were required to stop every 150 yards, send up a skyrocket, wait eight minutes for the road to clear before proceeding cautiously, all the while blowing their horn and shooting off flares.

I am already giving fore thought to what I will focus my master's in history on, I'm not sure of the details yet but I know it will cover the USSR. I was recently reading about Stalin when it hit me that there are likely still people alive that knew Stalin and have met him. This absolutely fascinates me to think about, that there are people still alive today who had personal relationships with a man who everyone considers to be history long gone. As such, I would love more than anything to get in contact and meet with anyone who knew or has met Stalin, even if just briefly, both for outstanding material for my master's thesis and also to fulfill a deep personal interest.

From seeing historical footage (and movies, and so on) I have a pretty good idea of what American ""Doughboys"" looked like in World War One, and I think I would be hard pressed to find anyone that doesn't recognize the typical American soldier in WWII. However, I'm not really sure what the American military looked like, especially during the Great Depression.

See, Hualarotlan was the central trading nation, since it's the last place with a port before the roads to the other landlocked countries with stuff to sell and buy. But the trade route goes along the Olisian coast before reaching Hualarotlan. Olisia decided to up its tariffs on goods travelling along its coast, which it can get away with because its coast is also regularly bombarded by hurricans, and Olisian ports are the best shelter for these ships. This coulda been debated and diplomats could have figured out a solution, but throw in some shady dealings and petty politicians and an assassination attempt, and it led to war.

So, how long would the Hualarotlan-Olisian war last? Most countries back Hualarotlan, but are either too far away to provide more than a military threat in Olisia's peripheral vision, or economic support. While Olisia is outnumbered, it is stronger than Hualarotlan, commanding more land, ergo more resources and soldiers, and a larger navy, though the hurricanes rule out any attempt at a siege of a port town.",How long do most trade wars go?

762,history,"I'm reading Caesar's chronicles (I am just past Caesar's defeat at Gergovia), and one of the things that really stands out to me is how Caesar portrays his troops basically ""licking their lips"" for battle, and at times begging him to let them fight the enemy. It's also a common trope for the army to shame the legates if they weren't aggressively engaging the enemy. I know that Caesar's writings are undoubtedly influenced by propaganda, which is why I ask how overblown his claims were, but this also seems typical of Romans throughout the Republican period, and Rome's military successes speak for themselves, so I'm inclined to believe there's some veracity to what Caesar is saying. 

From what we know about ancient warfare, it may well have been one of the worst things humans experienced, especially at such a large scale. Nobody wants to Halloween-style hack anyone to death, and almost everybody should be terrified of being on the receiving end, and I've heard Dan Carlin describe situations were the teeth chattering in the ranks was the incredibly loud. Then we have Caesar describing his troops, when faced with a numerically superior enemy on a hill surrounded by a literal swamp at Avaricum, saying ""The soldiers were angry that the enemy was even allowed to tolerate the sight of their army at such close range and demanded the signal for battle. But Caesar explained to them what heavy losses they would suffer and how many brave men's deaths the victory would inevitably cost. When he saw them so determined to accept any and all risks in order to win him glory, he said, he would deserve to be judged guilty of the most terrible injustice if he did not a place a higher value on their lives than on his own welfare."" This isn't the best passage to describe what I'm talking about, but it's the closest to where I currently am.

Now the propaganda is obviously spread on pretty thick here, but these troops really seem to be of a different class than anything else in history. Sure we see them having trouble with soldiers ""ducking out"" at the Sabis when they were ambushed by the Nervii, but if Caesar had done what he should have and posted a couple legions in formation and on guard in case of such an event I don't think the battle would have even been a contest and morale would not have been an issue. Remember, with how the random battle line came together, many of these soldiers were separated from their units.

That was a bit long winded, but have there been other examples in history of entire armies being this *insane* and having this much courage/bloodlust? The Romans seem like absolute maniacs and I'm interested if other units like the Ottoman's Janissaries or other ""elite"" units ever displayed similar characteristics.

&amp;#x200B;

So this question is partially inspired because I'm a huge fan of the Total War video games.  That said, one thing that always bothered me about them was how often horses end up involved in siege battles.  As you play through the game, both the attacking and defending forces have the option to use mounted soldier units during the sieges, and in some cases they can really end up crowding the battlefield.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always assumed that horses were never a big part of premodern sieges, especially when it comes to the actual combat, so it always broke my immersion, but I was wondering, am I wrong on this?  Are there examples of widespread use of cavalry  troops in siege battles, even inside city walls?  If so, what eras, how frequently, and how were they used?  Because I still don't feel like I see much practicality in it.  And of course I only mean troops that actually fight on horseback, not traditionally ride horses but dismount for this type of fight.

So I was wondering it is even true or something Ive just read from other sources somehow transplanting itself into Gettysburg. 

During a stop near one of the low stone walls the story was told. Roughly goes as follows 

""Here is where one of the more outlandish stories originates. During the battle a group of Union soldiers was under fire as they took cover behind this stone wall. 2 soldiers in particular of note here, one was a smaller man sitting beside his friend, a behemoth of a man as they were fired upon. As they returned fire the smaller man was hit. He died in the large mans arms, his best friend watching him slip from life. Enraged the large man charged the Confederate force firing upon them taking up a melee weapon(I think it was either a scythe or something else unconventional to be in the hands of a union soldier) throwing chaos among them killing dozens uncaring of any wounds he took. Eventually the Confederates manage to disengage some of their men from the melee and surrond the giant out of his reach. They fire and fell the giant ending his rampage."" 

Im 100% sure thats incorrect in some sense but is a vague semblance to what I remember. If anyone else knows if any stories like that exist from Gettysburg Id be delighted to know.

859,history,"Source: ISBN 978-9949-39-125-7  ""Facts and Legends of Second World War"" by Mati Õun, Estonian historian  
  
Digging his book again during the morning dump, it just reminded how I simply can't wrap my head around those numbers ( I know I have red a book of his with Much more detailed descriptions, dates and numbers but can't remember the title tho) :  
  
The Red Army and NKVD had on 1st of September 1939 **twice**  as many tanks and tankettes **and twice** as many combat airplanes than the **whole world combined**.  
  
Red Army and NKVD on the 22th of July 1941:  
  
*  32 100 aircraft (of which 24488 were combat aircraft)(altho majority were old and poor condition, like Po-2 biplanes etc)   
*  25 784 tank and tankettes  
*  5 242 armored cars  
*  112 800 pieces of different kind of artillery and mortars  
*  6 114 700 personnel *before* general mobilization  
*  also somewhat ~200 submarines if I recall correctly  
  
On the other hand Wehrmacht and SS had at the time:  
  
*  7 234 000 personnel (after general mobilization)  
*  Luftwaffe had 5070 aircraft (of which 4628 combat aircraft)    
*  5262 tanks and tankettes (of which 3332 were prepared for Barbarossa)  
  
Needless to say Soviet ones are *STRAGGERING* numbers I can't wrap mind onto. Makes perfect sense to me to let Europe weaken themselves while fighting with eachother, then, under the false call of ""liberation of Europe"" from nazism/fascism you invade and proceed to use Europe's massive industry to fuel your world conquering. Õun also bet the whole Comintern's skirmish in Spain during 1930s was to get foothold onto the other side of Europe to get Groza going from two fronts.  
He also isn't fond of that majority of 'western' historians don't seem to look onto the WWII from operation Groza's point of view as it totally reinvisions the much of the conflict that took place in Europe  
   
He is also a believer for operation Groza that was supposed to begin in like ~20 days after the Barbarossa basing his opinion on [Igor Bunich's](http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no93-28522/) books

861,history,"So, I was thinking about buying a modern day Mongolian horse in the US, I found out it is just about impossible unless you are willing to go to Mongolia and ship it to back to the States (I am not BTW).  But, as a byproduct, started reading about modern day Mongolian horses.  I found out they are drastically different (at least through my 15 minutes worth of research) than their modern Western counterparts.  The Western (European particularly) breeds seem to be more geared to towards work.  They are large, and very dependent on commands from their riders.  Where the modern Mongolian horses are much smaller (in many online horse communities refer to them as poney breeds). However, they are very strong for their size, as they are much stockier than the Western breeds.  The difference that I found the most interesting between the breeds, is Western horses must commanded for everything in order to ride them properly; where Mongolian horses are much more independent.  Meaning, the Mongolian breeds more or less do what they want and you don't have to command them in order to avoid obstacles such as large rocks.  Having an independent thinking horse (to me at least) would be highly beneficial for horse archery, as the rider can focus on shooting the opposing army.  However, having a strong very obedient horse would be much better suited to having heavily armored knights, as the rider could command the horse to charge directly into the opposing army and the knight can do his work from there.   

Finally, it seems to me, this has always been the case historically (the difference between the two breeds that is), in particularly in the case of the Mongolian horses.  As it appears the modern day breeds are more or less unchanged since at least the Mongol era, and potentially dating back all the way to the Scythians.  

I just thought this was really cool, and it, to me atleast, explains why the Steppe cultures were so dominate when they attacked Europe when the Europeans were unprepared and disorganized.

But when learning about the English Civil war that saw, a century earlier, the beheading of king Charles I and the institution of a Republic, it seems to me that the ideas, reforms and models implemented on the isles were as threatening to the concept of divine kingship as the French Revolution’s. 

The « Grandees » and Rump Parliament were barely less radical than the Jacobins and Cromwell barely more liberal and conciliatory than Robespierre. And either way, the Counter-Revolution seems to have started before the emergence of these figures in France.

931,history,"Despite being a largely unbroken continuation of the Ancient Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire military history couldn’t be any more different than its distant past, at least at first glance. 

The Ancient Roman Empire was one of constant expansion and conquest, a tradition dating back to its days as a republic. 

On the other hand, the Byzantine Empire, despite regaining some of its territory during the Komnenoi and other limited achievements, has (to my recollection) no grand conquests (beyond Justinian’s) to its name.

What’s the reason behind this?

Was there an ideological difference between the Romans of old and the Medieval Byzantines that  discouraged conquest in part of the Byzantines (middle and late, since early Byzantines would probably not be too different than late Romans), or was the lack of Byzantine grand conquests more a practical limitation?

I am halfway through ""A Column of Fire"" by Ken Follet (3rd book of the ""Pillars of the Earth"" series), and while I find it vastly inferior to the first two books, it does cover a period I am pretty familiar with, and very fond of since I read the excellent French series ""Fortune de France"" (if you are interested, it has only started being translated very recently, with 3 of the 6 first books available in English, check it out!).

One thing I had never wondered about before that stuck out to me in ""Column"" is how Geneva, the centre of protestant teaching, ruled by Jean Calvin, sending missionaries, translated bibles and other books throughout Europe, survived the military struggles that spanned the period, with catholic powers such as France, Spain and of course the Pope dedicating a lot of energy to suppress heresy.

I am not very clear on the power balance of the area at the time. I think Geneva was an independant city? And not a very big one. Not a major trading power such as the Italian republics… Switzerland was not united, and I have read that Geneva mainly had an alliance with Bern. I guess together they could still muster a pretty big army, especially since Swiss mercenaries were such a quality force.

But it still feels to me like if France or Spain had wanted to smash the heresy in its heart, they could have gathered an army and marched on Geneva.

Why did they not do this? Is my assessment of Geneva's power wrong? Or (maybe also) did the internal struggles within France/Spain, and the constant power struggle between the 2 kingdoms, prevented them from planning a war abroad, even though Geneva is just on the doorstep of France… Are there other factors, political or otherwise, that I'm not seeing?",Why or how did no catholic power subdue Geneva during the wars between catholics and protestants?

The first thing that popped up in my head was the implementation of Communism in Russia, China and the other satellite countries. 

On one hand, the theory and mentality behind it makes sense considering from the time of the Victorian era and the Industrial Revolution, the higher social classes were getting more rich and having more luxury while the lower classes were getting little so I can understand the anger and frustration from the lower classes.

They had no effective administration, bureaucracy or institutions, just senseless violence and the literal slaughtering of their own population

What exactly was their long-term plan for running a state? Did they seriously believe that murdering an increasing percentage of their own population would have no effect on their state? What if the Vietnamese never intervened and the regime remained in Power? Would they literally just have continued to slaughter away their entire population until nobody would have been left? If so, how did they see any value in a situation like this?

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)

Has there been any documentation of this notion being used only to quickly end up being betrayed by the enemy of their enemy? I am talking about cases where the other nation perhaps agrees to go to war and then quickly declares war upon the people they had allied with. Not necessarily cases like Italy in WW1 where they found a reason to not join the Central Powers in war due to only being part of a defensive alliance and used this to justify their action of later declaring war on the Central powers. I mean cases where they agree to go to war only to then declare war on those who sought the alliance in the first place. Also if there have been cases of the alliance falling into war after they defeat their mutual enemy would also be interesting.

977,history,"I was just doing a little reading on Rome and I couldn't help but think that it's really weird the way that the Cimbrian war seems like a bit of a footnote in Roman history when their other major enemies and defeats are so notorious and still have a certain pop history notoriety. People know about things like the catastrophe at Cannae and Hannibal's genius, Crassus meeting a miserable end against the horse archers at Carrhae, or the treachery and cunning of Arminius in the Teutoburg Forest. Even some of the later defeats like the capture of Valerian at Edessa or the disaster at Adrianople in 378 have left a bit of a mark.

But the Battle of Arausio seems like it should be a huge fucking deal, apparently it was the single largest defeat in all of Roman history, almost 100,000 casualties at this one battle! The Cimbrian war was the last time Italy itself would be threatened by an existential threat for centuries, the war was instrumental for Marius and his reforms, and it probably marked the entrance of Germanic tribes as major players in Roman history, why doesn't this get a bunch of documentaries, movies and videogames?!","Why isn't the Battle of Arausio as well know as other Roman defeats like Cannae, Carrhae, Teutoburg Forest etc?"

984,history,"So I have been doing a bit of research about the philosophical foundations of martial arts (mostly Eastern) as I have always been a fan of martial arts and philosophy too and how they both are entangled with each other and how most martial arts taught and practiced that it can be implied in all aspects of life.

&amp;#x200B;

(and interestingly, despite how Eastern martial arts seem to be very similar to each other especially in terms of their philosophies, they are actually quite distinct in certain details. There is a difference between a Buddhist monk who practices Shaolin Buddhist martial arts, and the actual Buddhist warrior monks, known as the Sohei or the Ikko-Ikki. This also applies to other martial arts and their sub-disciplines that how they are taught such as Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, and Hapkimudo (the ""mudo"" means ""mu"" - ""warrior"" and ""do"" - mind) and the ""traditional"" or ""soft"" practice of Tae Kwon Do that focuses more on self-control, respect and so on, and the more ""modern"" Tae Kwon Do that focuses more on (controlled) aggressiveness, physical fitness and fighting and competition (which is the one that you see in martial arts competitions)

&amp;#x200B;

From my research so far, most Eastern martial arts are originated by the Bushido code, sometimes known simply as Budo or Bu, which has deeply philosophical-religious-spiritual ties with Shinto whose concepts and teachings are difficult to explain concretely (like the emphasis on ""ki"" or ""chi"" which are basically spiritual life energy that is defined as the essence of everything and every living being and can be controlled and exerted to your will if controlled correctly. Basically it is like the Force from Star Wars) where the Bushido code have been a very strict, yet also general code for the samurai to follow that focused a lot on integrity, honour, courage, self-control, and respect (there is a general criticism nowadays that modern martial arts focused too much on the competition and little on their connections with Bushido).

&amp;#x200B;

However, despite that the samurai have been a very respected social class in Feudal Japan for centuries, there were many conflicts in Feudal Japan and there were even different kinds of Samurai like pirate samurai (""Wokou""), masterless samurai (""Ronin"") who were treated with a status that was similar to criminals as they were treated as people with shame and dishonour (mostly for not committing the seppuku after they lost their master),  there were even black Samurai (""Yasuke"").

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this,  I am assuming that not every samurai followed the Bushido code to the rule and considering that Feudal Japan experienced changes throughout history too, I am assuming that even different samurai had different codes of their own too (like the pirate samurai or the ronin)

&amp;#x200B;

So what was the Bushido code exactly?",What was the Bushido code exactly?

987,history,"I've started reading Froissart's Chronicles, and one point that I've become very interested in is that King Edward consistently stipulates that Knights, Barons, etc. from foreign countries that come to his feast to joust and join his table will be given safe-conduct for 15 days (something like 15 days). This means that they'll have some sort of security around them to help them get back to their homeland.

My question is that why is it necessary for these otherwise powerful Barons, Knights to have safe-conduct through the country when they are there by invitation. Is there an increased amount of passive danger just travelling about in these countries (during this time period) which is not mentioned in historical first-hand accounts?

Is it reasonable to expect that even in the face of danger these Knights would have the means to defend themselves and ensure their own safe conduct?

What kind of threats are promises of safe-conduct meant to protect against? Opportunistic common people in the country that want others' stuff? Other knights in the land acting as aggressors against any foreign knight/soldier/baron?

Colombian here - the history of the slave trade in the Caribbean (and subsequently much of the reason that there are huge black populations up and  down the atlantic coasts in Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, etc.) However, it is well known that a huge portion of the population in the coastal areas of the Pacific are either native or of African descent.

Herein lies the problem, how or why did this population end up there? The costal regions of the pacific are intense and inhospitable; thick mangroves, mosquitoes, salty soil which makes agriculture difficult, violent seas, intense heat and humidity.  There are not many large cities on the Pacific in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador. And for Colombia specifically, much of the agriculture is further inland (in places like Cali, for sugar cane and maze).
