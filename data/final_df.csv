32,"The music industry actively mocks the idea of fidelity in a relationship, celebrates sexual deviancy and non-committed relationships.The collapse of the family.",0,"The music industry actively mocks the idea of fidelity in a relationship, celebrates sexual deviancy and non-committed relationships.The collapse of the family.So I don't really think many people would challenge the underlying premise of this observation. It is fairly obvious that the music industry tends to promote a lifestyle of extravagance, frivolousness, sexual promiscuity, and a fixation on the ""passion"" or ""fairytale"" parts of a relationship, namely getting together, breaking up, falling in love, or fantasizing about having now met your ""one and only"". None of these things are sustainable and create false ideas of what love for another person really is. I often like to state that I believe the music of Bruno Mars to be much more toxic than even the most vile black metal or brutal gangster rap, simply because he promotes the false image sold to us by western culture which just happens to be the cotton candy oxycontin lifestyle. But for the focus of this post I would like to bring up the song Honey I'm Good by Andy Grammar, I happen to believe that this song is the industry's most obvious statement on this topic. In the song Andy speaks of being at a bar and being asked to join another patron for a drink, Andy wants to but knows that if he does he will likely cheat, so he instead decides to stop having fun in order to stay true. When you consider the fact that the entire song is set to a goofy Cotton Eyed Joe-like tune the message is fairly obvious,  this is meant to be a mockery of the faithful mentality. It's nauseating redundancy solidifies this opinion and the songs promotion of the square/uncool person who engages in this kind of behavior. Just curious what you guys think, when I first heard this song on the radio it struck me as very obviously angled to a particular cause and I'm interested if you guys think there are other songs out there which follow a similar pattern.

36,The story behind the kid who showed the winning lottery numbers before their drawing is insanely sketchy,0,"The story behind the kid who showed the winning lottery numbers before their drawing is insanely sketchyHeres everything I know and that has happened so far (there may be something I missed so feel free to add):

&amp;#x200B;

I subscribed to a Youtube channel about a young guy who seemed to just make things in his workshop. His most recent videos were becoming odd though.. He explained more and more that the reason he took a year off from uploading was so he could form relations with ""powerful people."" He then claimed the winning Powerball numbers for the following day were placed in the video because the lotteries are rigged by the rich for them to win.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next upload he said the same thing: the winning lottery numbers were hidden in the video. The title was disgiused because he noted it would ""stay up longer"".

&amp;#x200B;

Everything about them raised red flags for me as being a hoax, but I posted it on this Reddit anyway. In hindsight that was a fuckin stupid idea because if he had happened to upload another one I might've been able to win. Luckily, he didn't.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b519es/guy\_showed\_the\_winning\_numbers\_for\_wednesdays/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b519es/guy_showed_the_winning_numbers_for_wednesdays/)

&amp;#x200B;

And, as it turns out he wasn't bullshitting. Twice in a row, he displayed winning lottery numbers a full day before the drawing. The first video had sticky notes with the numbers attached to his hat and the second just literally showed them as text mid-video.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so fucking frustrated and angry that I subscribed literally less than a day too late to be able to play the numbers! The few people who had seen the video prior to me either didn't see the numbers or didn't believe him because there were no jackpot winners on the 20th and 23rd. I just try to keep telling myself that it was meant to be, especially because of what happened next.

&amp;#x200B;

His final video was of him almost in tears saying that ""they"" were almost to him. He noted he was previously slowly giving out the number combos as so to not raise suspicion due to many winners. But because he knew he was going to get captured anyway he gave a link to a deep web (or dark web or whatever, i'm not savvy with this stuff) website that the rich apparently use to coordinate what numbers to play and what times to win.

[the only evidence I have that this video ever existed](https://i.redd.it/q8sk9cgu6rp21.png)

I didn't manage to record this video because I was still at work but I did write down the website. I had my tech buddy look it up immeditely, and he said the site was already down, less than an hour after the guy showed it running in the video. Also at this time all of his videos were deleted. Totally not weird at all.

Site: 9sdgnehfarver911.onion

&amp;#x200B;

A bit later I got an email from Reddit about a DMCA takedown request for my post. It talked about legal action and stuff, so I immediately deleted the post (I found out later that was unnecessary. Sorry I got kinda scared, I'm still new to Reddit. I created my account a couple years back but I haven't really liked this site until I tried it again last month).

https://i.redd.it/8z3woxcu6rp21.png

Today was the nail in the coffin. He uploaded a suspicous AF video saying that it was all an April Fool's joke. I don't buy it. It's really forced and obviously scripted, and still doesn't explain how the hell he actually did show the winning numbers a full day before any of the drawings.

They decided a few years ago that the 1940's were actually cooler than the scientists then measured, so they lowered those temperatures in the record, making the present warmer. Instant Global Warming!About a year and a half ago those 'adjustments' were looked at in detail, and it was determined nearly all the Global Warming of the last few years... comes from those adjustments.

 

[This study](https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/ef-gast-data-research-report-062717.pdf) looked at **"" current surface temperature datasets managed by NASA, NOAA and the UK‚Äôs Met Office, all of which make adjustments to raw thermometer readings.""**

‚ÄúNearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments,‚Äù Meteorologist Joe D‚ÄôAleo, a study co-author ‚ÄúEach dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming.‚Äù

**‚ÄúYou would think that when you make adjustments you‚Äôd sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling. That‚Äôs almost never happened,‚Äù** said D‚ÄôAleo.

Their study found measurements **‚Äúnearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history,‚Äù which was ‚Äúnearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúThe conclusive findings of this research are that the three \[global average surface temperature\]¬†data sets are not a valid representation of reality,‚Äù the study found. ‚ÄúIn fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.‚Äù**",1,climat scientist love to chang data they decid a few year ago that the s were actual cooler than the scientist then measur so they lower those temperatur in the record make the present warmer instant global warm,climat scientist love to chang data they decid a few year ago that the s were actual cooler than the scientist then measur so they lower those temperatur in the record make the present warmer instant global warm about a year and a half ago those adjust were look at in detail and it wa determin nearli all the global warm of the last few year come from those adjust thi studi http thsresearch file wordpress com ef gast data research report pdf look at current surfac temperatur dataset manag by nasa noaa and the UK s met offic all of which make adjust to raw thermomet read what did it find glad you ask nearli all of the warm they are now show are in the adjust meteorologist joe D aleo a studi co author each dataset push down the s warm and push up the current warm you would think that when you make adjust you d sometim get warm and sometim get cool that s almost never happen said D aleo their studi found measur nearli alway exhibit a steeper warm linear trend over it entir histori which wa nearli alway accomplish by systemat remov the previous exist cyclic temperatur pattern the conclus find of thi research are that the three global averag surfac temperatur data set are not a valid represent of realiti the studi found In fact the magnitud of their histor data adjust that remov their cyclic temperatur pattern are total inconsist with publish and credibl U S and other temperatur data

The #1 predictor of disease is diet/lifestyle. dont be fooled into thinking the  disproportionate rates of chronic disease in the US is anything but design. 

From the source linked below: 

""The USDA supports industries that produce foods contributing to obesity, heart disease, and cancer. Worse yet, ""[t]he USDA buys hundreds of millions of pounds of excess beef, pork, milk, and other high-fat meat and dairy products to bolster [or normalize] dropping prices.,, It then dumps those commodities into the National School Lunch Program (""NSLP,,).  

Medical journals empirically demonstrate the coronary health benefits of near-vegetarian meals, yet most schools offer meals based primarily on a combination of meat and dairy products, which are high in fat and low in nutritional quality.

Newer studies link lactose intolerance to children of African American descent, yet most schools still do not offer nondairy alternatives like soy milk on their menus. 

The USDA seems to resolve its conflict of interest,in favor of the dairy lobby over the community of lactose-intolerant children. Powerful agricultural lobbies will always win so long as the USDA has oversight of the NSLP and continues to ignore this conflict of interest.""

Autism could result from more than one cause, with different manifestations in different individuals that share common symptoms. Documented causes of autism include genetic mutations and/or deletions, viral infections, and encephalitis following vaccination.

This study demonstrates that very low-levels of Thimerosal can contribute to immune system disregulation.

 *Exp Toxicol Pathol. 2009 Mar;61(2):133-6. Epub 2008 Sep 3.*   
 *Branch DR, Departments of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto*

A recent report shows a correlation of the historical use of thimerosal in therapeutic immunizations with the subsequent development of autism; however, this association remains controversial. Autism occurs approximately four times more frequently in males compared to females; thus, studies of thimerosal toxicity should take into consideration gender-selective effects. The present study was originally undertaken to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of thimersosal in male and female CD1 mice. However, during the limited MTD studies, it became apparent that thimerosal has a differential MTD that depends on whether the mouse is male or female.

This study demonstrates clearly and unequivocally that ethyl mercury, the kind of mercury found in vaccines, not only ends up in the brain, but leaves double the amount of inorganic mercury as methyl mercury, the kind of mercury found in fish. This work is groundbreaking because little is known about ethyl mercury, and many health authorities have asserted that the mercury found in vaccines is the ‚Äúsafe kind.‚Äù This study also delivers a strong rebuke of the Institute of Medicine‚Äôs recommendation in 2004 to no longer pursue the mercury-autism connection.

Autism is defined behaviorally, as a syndrome of abnormalities involving language, social reciprocity and hyperfocus or reduced behavioral flexibility. It is clearly heterogeneous, and it can be accompanied by unusual talents as well as by impairments, but its underlying biological and genetic basis in unknown. Autism has been modeled as a brain-based, strongly genetic disorder, but emerging findings and hypotheses support a broader model of the condition as a genetically influenced and systemic.

On February 19, 2019 he announced a 250M moneyline, now 70M into it he has decided to no longer continue, effectively shutting down the league immediately.
 
The interesting part is he has previously said *""If the players union (of the NFL) is not going to give us young players, we can't be a development league.""*
 
The thing is he is friendly with NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice ""De"" Smith, he would have known this before injected money into the AAF. So why now, just weeks later, is he immediately shutting down the league?
 
I believe that was the plan from the start, that long-term the NFL wants no other competitive professional football leagues and now people will show less interest in the upcoming XFL league because it may be believed it could fail during the season like the AAF just did.

86,Global Warming is a Trillion Dollar / Year Industry.,0,"Global Warming is a Trillion Dollar / Year Industry.The Climate Change Business Journal has calculated that global warming is now a $1.5 trillion a year industry. The Business Journal‚Äôs report is not available for free online, but its findings are reviewed by the Insurance Journal. They are eye-opening, to say the least:

The $1.5 trillion global ‚Äúclimate change industry‚Äù grew at between 17 and 24 percent annually from 2005-2008, slowing to between 4 and 6 percent following the recession with the exception of 2011‚Äôs inexplicable 15 percent growth, according to Climate Change Business Journal.

The San Diego, Calif.-based publication includes within that industry nine segments and 38 sub-segments. This encompasses sectors like renewables, green building and hybrid vehicles.

One of the most lucrative segments of the global warming money tree is consulting:

That also includes the climate change consulting market, which a recent report by the journal estimates at $1.9 billion worldwide and $890 million in the U.S.

Included in this sub-segment, which the report shows is one of the fastest growing areas of the climate change industry, are environmental consultants and engineers, risk managers, assurance, as well as legal and other professional services.

What is striking about the global warming industry is that its growth is driven more or less entirely by ‚Äúpolicymaking,‚Äù i.e., government mandates and other policies. This is why ‚Äúgreen‚Äù businesses contribute so lavishly to the political campaigns of politicians who drink the global warming Kool-aid.

When I first noticed it, I began reporting the posts but it doesn't seem like anything has changed in well over a couple months which leads me to believe one of the following scenarios:

1) Reddit admins know about it and can't stop it (It's a honey pot/active investigation, etc.)

2) Reddit admins know about it and are complicit in the activity.

3) Reddit admins don't know and the reporting is handled via some auto-pilot scheme.

SS: Im going to be as Quick and as to the point as I can be.  I was out in the backyard enjoying the day when what looked like a blue and red low flying commercial airliner traveling 300 degrees NW slightly before 1pm AZ time caught the corner of my eye. It appeared to have a black object come from it. The object began moving upward. 

I watched the object for awhile because honestly I wanted to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a bird. When I made up my mind that it wasn‚Äôt a bird I ran into the house to get a camera better than my iPhones capabilities. When I returned outside I immediately looked for the black object. No luck. 

When I then went to look for the commercial airliner I got distracted by a loud noise. I looked above and a fighter jet flew overhead traveling from the South Heading North. Now the conspiracy wheels are spinning......

2 more fighter jets show up. Then a 4th. They make a big circle around the area and head North/West.

If anyone else has any more info it would be greatly appreciated. Oh, and I did snap some photos of the fighter jets. This is not an April fools Joke. I‚Äôm probably the fool. I‚Äôm sure there is a logical explanation. Some kind of Air-force exercise or something. Thanks!

135,Imagine no theory of relativity. It is easy if you try.,0,"Imagine no theory of relativity. It is easy if you try.Did you know if the theory of relativity did not exist, then Michelson and Morley experiment showed that the earth did not move around the sun? Did you know the theory of relativity was an answer to Michelson and Morley? I can provide citations for both these Did You Knows.

The Principle of Equivalence, used in the theory of relativity correctly predicts that even massless photons ""fall"" inside both an elevator accelerating up in deep space (trivial) and near heavy objects like earth (not so trivial. shouldn't gravity be between masses?). In relativity the latter case of gravity influencing massless photons is explained by postulating that the space curves around heavy objects and bends light towards such objects. Again here if the theory of relativity did not exist, then the effect of earth's gravity on photons can only be explained by saying earth is moving up much like an elevator in deep space. But even that won't be enough, the earth would have to be flat too while accelerating up, to make photons fall towards it.

Imagine no theory of relativity. It is easy if you try. No globe below us and above us only sky.

If you have read so far, congratulations. You are an open minded person. I'm not saying theory of relativity is not true. I'm just imagining it weren't.

Besides to really stop believing in theory of relativity I would have to explain how light bends around heavy objects like the sun during solar eclipses. These sort of effects makes me want to believe in the theory of relativity.

""What a load of shit.

&gt;It is happening because of combinational frequency rates of atoms (waves); and their limited capacities. When the current is introduced to the body the frequency used allows a very specific amount of space of/for vibration.  
&gt;  
&gt;This ensnares a cell as it moves through all waves in the sense that it only allows specific vibration to occur

It's like a moron opened a biology text book and started using words out of context to try and sound clever.

Response: In laymans terms this means that it is my blood reacting to electrical current, and that it safely died off so that it could be reused; this form of cell death is known to be beneficial to all cancers.

This proves though that the electrical current is in fact nothing more than vibration, and that vibration can affect cells. We already know that through ultrasounds.

Something to add to this, is that GE science division recently completed an experiment which also proves this. The experiment showed that ultrasound has effect on glucose modulation when pointed towards the liver.

166,I'm Going To The Richat Structure To Investigate Atlantis!,0,"I'm Going To The Richat Structure To Investigate Atlantis! 

https://i.redd.it/40bjrtsapjp21.png

Hey everyone! Well, I'm probably crazy, but I'm going to the Richat Structure in Mauritania to investigate many coordinates that seem to show man-made structures. Also doing some tests and hoping to uncover something there! Heavily inspired since I saw Bright Insight's incredible videos on Atlantis!  


**My video report on my journey can be found here:**  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Lc8KxbhigE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lc8KxbhigE)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's my original article for the video:**  
In this video, I report on my plan to go to the Richat Structure in Mauritania to search for Atlantis, the so-called mythical ancient city detailed by Plato in his Critias and Timaeus dialogues thousands of years ago.

We have decided that the best way to find out the truth is to go to the site itself and explore on the ground using coordinates that appear to be the most promising.

The number of pieces of evidence are so overwhelming that it's hard to write down in a simple description.

The Richat Structure, also known as ""The Eye Of The Sahara"" and ""The Eye Of Africa"" lays deeps in the Sahara Desert in the country of Mauritania. It is on a plateau covered in water erosion and is the perfect size to be the city Plato recounted from the info handed down by his ancestor Solon. It is 23.5kms around the main island. Exactly as recounted. It opens to the south with mountains covered in rivers to the north. It has fresh water in the center island and salt water throughout the other rings. That area of the Sahara used to be jungle before suddenly turning to desert in a catacylsm. You can see from space that much of the land was washed out as if land slid from the mantle into the ocean.

As we've detailed greatly here at WAM, nearly every ancient civilization spoke of a great catacylsm, most of a flood that washed out coastal cities and set humanity back. Interestingly, of the 600 civilizations that recounted such an event throughout the world with no known connection with each other, the majority of the stories are the SAME with slight variations. Science has now proven that there was a massive climate cataclysm around the end of the Younger Dryas Period.

Put this together with the fact that in recent years, the true origin of civilizations throughout the world have changed people's perspective massively. Many academic researchers claimed for centuries that civilizations begun around 3000BC. As if people stopped climbing trees to suddenly build the greatest structures in human history that we still cannot replicate to this day and then slowly forget how to build such structures as structures got more and more primitive over time.

Then we've found Gobekli Tepe in the past 20+ years that dates back to the 10th century BC which then randomly got buried in the 8th on purpose. So civilizations suddenly advanced, built amazing building and then stopped for 5,000 years, then begun again. The storyline put forward by the major academics of the space has gotten ridiculous.

From water erosion on The Sphinx in Egypt (which claimed to be an outpost of Atlantis) to perfectly fitting polygonal blocks at Machu Picchu, we have been lied to and the Richat Structure near the Atlas Mountains and the Sea of Atlas (Atlantic Ocean) appears to be most likely site of Atlantis (The Island Of Atlas). So we're going there!

We will bring you on site video soon!

So a thought came to me ‚Äúthis sort of reminds me of metro‚Äù. So I started googling keywords such as ‚Äúpredictive programming metro 2033‚Äù and barely found a dent of info. So I thought that‚Äôs odd, I know I‚Äôm not the only one thinking like this. 

So here I am asking about metro‚Äôs weird and ironic placement in time. I do feel a war is very close and I‚Äôm planning to prepare food,water,ammo and all that‚Äôs needed to survive. I also have thoughts of alien/demons invasions due to these random triangles in the sky or CERN pop‚Äôin creatures from a portal during the aftermath and really creating a sense of metro 2033. 

All I know is there are a collection of strange events both physically, spiritually. I‚Äôm the type of mind who believes that movies,tv,music tell details of future events and preps the subconscious for a setting or event that is soon to come. Could metro be one of those games? I feel currently there is a nuclear arms race and believe that all the worlds kingdoms will lose more than they anticipate. 

Bonus question: Why are the central banks, Russia and China buying tons of gold while the market is at a all time high? Is the dollar in trouble?

If I break any rules, please let a brother know.

Some capabilities of their tech can be found in the lyrics of the song ""Sleeping Awake"" by POD.

""Do you see what I see?

Do you feel like I feel?
Do you dream like I dream?""

https://genius.com/Pod-sleeping-awake-lyrics

They can see what you see, hear what you hear, etc. They can even make you dream like in that movie ""Inception"".

This article about them is correct but fails to mention their REMOTE MIND CONTROL tech.

https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/wikileaks-calls-qanon-a-likely-pied-piper-operation-e5c4f4fac4a

Edward Snowden most likely also knows about this tech and gave information about it to China and Russia, which is why Q likes to attack him.

Quote from edwardsnowden.com

‚ÄúI don't want to live in a world where everything I say, everything I do, everyone I talk to, every expression of creativity and love or friendship is recorded.‚Äù 

What do you think he meant by ""everything I do""?

Anyway, it seems to me that Q is only allowing so-called ""targeted individuals"" to access the threads on 8ch.net/qresearch (the ""general"" threads, which are also called breads, by the way). Tried to view a thread where I had posted about their REMOTE MIND CONTROL tech with a web proxy and only got a blank page, for example.

First time I figured out who they were and came here wanting to post, they made it seem like they control the entire internet. That is probably not the case, but they definitely seem to control CLOUDFLARE, TWITTER, etc (and of course 8chan obviously). So, they can probably manipulate any site that is using Cloudflare (like voat). And as for Twitter, check Q posts threatening Jack Dorsey.

Let's see if they indeed control the ""entire internet"". Let's see what happens to this post and if it's indexed by search engines like Google or not.

I have no doubt, (Q) jew team members will try and post comments threatening or ridiculing me after I make this post, assuming it even shows up. ;)

Forgot to mention that one of the reasons I think it's a ""jew team"" is because they absolutely hate ""effective"" anti-jew content being posted on their 8chan threads.

Example ""effective"" anti-jew content:

Fascinating stuff to anyone interested in ancient finds in North America and the consequent Smithsonian cover-ups (though Graham doesn't focus on cover-ups; he discusses the implications of his findings).  
  
Not shilling for Graham -- though I do personally believe I'll purchase the book to support his efforts.
  
On another note, Graham specifically mentions that he believes this civilization would have had technology similar to ours sometime around the late 18th or 19th centuries -- before planes and computers, but way more advanced than what we would expect.  He also theorizes that this civilization's epicenter may have been 500 km south of Minnesota (not sure why he says it this way) -- but you're basically looking at Iowa/Nebraska.  
  
Also talks some about ayahuasca.

Artificial scarcity, in healthcare licensing and schooling, easily makes enough $$ for corporate PR that suppresses and memory-holes anything critical about this.#Monopolistic protectionist policies in medical (medical field generally) school admissions reduces the supply of medical providers, further raises the barrier to entry, and reduces competition among providers.  This reduces medical patient options in the care/treatment process, reinforces the power of licensing monopolies, reinforces a small elite of medical providers, decreases competition among medical professionals, decreases the motivation for quality among medical professionals, creates an artificial scarcity of medical professionals, and encourages higher healthcare costs.


------------------------

Note:  discussion on 'more doctors doesn't matter if there's not more beds' is sometimes brought up as an excuse for monopolistic practices effecting the size of the medical workforce and easy access to medical care.  First, there are other factors affecting the artificial scarcity in medicine such as crony 'certificates of need' which serve to limit distribution of medical facilities and equipment. Second, medical providers benefit from making healthcare artificially scarce by getting higher prices and more elitist status.


&gt;The study, being published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found that the incomes of primary care doctors and orthopedic surgeons were substantially higher in the United States than in other countries. Moreover, it said, the difference results mainly from higher fees, not from higher costs of the doctors‚Äô medical practice, a larger number or volume of services or higher medical school tuition.

&gt;The average U.S. general-medicine physician makes $218,173 a year ‚Äî nearly double the average of all 11 countries. American specialists make $316,000, while their counterparts take home $98,452 in Sweden and $202,291 in Australia. American nurses make considerably more than elsewhere, too.

&gt;
&gt;What's Not Driving Up Prices: Too Much Care
&gt;
&gt;Foremost among the conclusions of the new Harvard paper is that unnecessary care ‚Äî tests and procedures that do nothing to promote health ‚Äî is not the biggest driver of America‚Äôs high health spending.

#Monopolistic practices in medical school and licensing authority and the manipulation of the supply (and price) of medical care


&gt;One of the most critical supply side issues in health care is the supply of qualified doctors.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The case of health care regulations is an interesting one, as state governments have empowered private medical boards with unilateral authority to set the rules for the medical profession, including the issuing and revoking of medical licenses. These boards effectively function like government regulatory agencies, with the important difference that they lack the opportunity for public comments, and thus are immune from any political pressure from citizens.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Retail clinics, pharmacies, and even supermarkets are capable of offering routine medical services to patients with a convenience and regularity impossible in traditional physicians‚Äô offices. Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) has aggressively lobbied against the availability of this type of facility.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;There are currently only 129 accredited medical schools in the United States, too few to turn out enough doctors to meet the demand.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;By reducing the regulatory burden on physicians, providing more competition among medical boards, and permitting more autonomy for alternative practitioners, patients could see both relief from the coming doctor shortage, as well as lower prices across the board for medical care.

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-19/how-government-helped-create-coming-doctor-shortage

&gt;To some extent, dentistry created its own problem. Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Health Association, said today's shortage of dentists can be traced to the closing of seven dental schools in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1980, he said, the United States produced 6,300 dentists. Ten years later, the number was down to 4,000.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Some groups representing doctors are resisting similar efforts to allow nurse practitioners to, for example, write prescriptions and admit patients to the hospital.

https://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2013/12/30/are_there_enough_doctors_for_the_newly_insured_786.html

&gt;The Association of American Medical Colleges has recently predicted a nationwide shortage of somewhere between 40,800 and 104,900 physicians by 2030.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ironically, one of the biggest obstacles to improving access to health care providers is the profession itself, enabled by a plethora of public and private agencies that control licensing and certification. These often inadvertently limit access to care rather than enhance it.

What happens next? The Rapper Nipsey gets shot &amp; killed.

Since this occurrence, the recording of his live stream was either deleted or I believe edited to be ""private"". But a lot of people that watch him recorded that segment of the live stream and are spreading it on twitter.

 Where is Desmond?  Who is doing this to him and why? Can he be saved? He seems to be with people who are above the law.

It's being more than two years of Trump presidency, but issue with Russian meddling is still looming. It seems that two years is more, than enough to find something, doesn't it? If there is something to find. And if you're searching in a right place. But for now, despite of titanic efforts, there is not even a hint was spotted‚Ä¶ It seems everything's pretty obvious - there is the result, there is the customer, there are professional intelligence analysts, but there is no result at all. What's going on? What's wrong?

Common sense rings that something is wrong - something from the set of things or the context. There is no doubt that the team of investigators is professional. Maybe somewhat influenced, but that would be clear after so long period of time. The result is obvious too - Trump defeated the almost 100% favorite Clinton. What about who ordered the hit?

Well, the customer-result pair at first glance only seems obvious. If Putin is a customer, it means that the result must have been political. But there is a problem - the longer than clearer. Only according to pro-Clinton mass media Trump is Putin's puppet. In reality a lot of his decisions made Putin angry. Moreover, sometime it seems there is no sense in his decisions at all. However, Trump made millions (and not once after hitting the bottom), so it's not likely there is no sense. Possibly, we just don't see it. Like for the same reason we don't drive a Rolls Royce and instead use subway. Just don't see opportunities to make enough to afford a Rolls Royce. It doesn't mean we are silly, we just see other things in life that, possible, can not help to make money, but they are important other ways. Money is not the happiness itself. By the way, constant Trump's stress is a good example of that common idea.

Well, what can be wrong in the pair customer-result? Obviously, the leading part there is the result. But the result not necerssary has to be  the one and only - presidency of the most powerful country in the world offers countless options. What was the result that all those mysterous hidden players played for? Seems the outcome has so many options that whatever you choose, it fits the goal. But let's not give up.

Where can find so essential hint? As usual - history will help!

Trump - one of a rare case of presidents, who actually follows his election promises. Since the election outcome was surprising, it's logically to test his promises for surprising ones. Was something unusual, somethining, that usually nobody promised? Seems nothing‚Ä¶ Just regular stuff about new jobs, more effective economy, politics‚Ä¶ Wait a minute! There was a thing! Returning to the Moon! Long years of complete silence and - snap! - here it is! A candidate with pretty questionable chances bring that subject from a dusty attic.

No, really, everybody are into Mars, Sun, asteroids, comets, deep space exploration‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0qk55mge1rp21.jpg

 But the Moon‚Ä¶ Dead, eroded by meteorites, without any atmosphere Earth's satellite? It's hard to count how many robotic devices were there, gathered a lot of interesting info. And landing of astronauts that added a huge chunk of understanding of the Moon. It was perfect training of extraterrestrial landing, since the Moon is a planet type satellite that gave perfect opportunity to play in a satellite ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù. But all results dubbed a simple fact that there is hardly something left to research at the Moon and almost everything significant was already well researched. Why  drowning in that old pool again?

However, there are a lot of people full of doubts that somebody actually visited the Moon. They claimed everything was shot in Hollywood. And there is time to come to the Moon for real. Are they right?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/f08lj6ej1rp21.jpg

 Not likely. One thing is to fake one Moon landing. The whole different story is to fake several times, especially under the close surveillance of the counterparts, especially USSR, that had pretty serious plans to win that race.

On the other hand, there are a lot of strange things in the US Moon program. For example, it turns out, Saturn 5, the mightiest rocket ever since is impossible to rebuild even at the current technology level.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l9cdmbbn1rp21.png

 The Moon soil was lost somewhat. And other small things, where, as everybody knows, the devil hides...

Well, landed or not landed? No, it is the wrong question. It's not the question if there was the expedition, since it's obvious that Moon landing was real. The real question is - why landing?

And here the most interesting part begins.

Indeed, results of robotic probes' work were pretty detailed and gave adequate picture what the Moon is. Why risk human lives? For sake of winning the space or, more accurate, Moon race? C'mon, it's childish. Why go there ‚Äúin person‚Äù? What else could we expect that robotic probes missed? And do this several times?

Wait a minute! What if from the beginning there was nothing planned to bring from the Moon? In contrary! It was the plan to deliver something to the Moon!

Hmm‚Ä¶ Well, under that angle‚Ä¶ No, really, if there was nothing to bring back from the Moon, that explains why everybody were so careless about the Moon soil - and, naturally, lost it. Same thing with the unique rocket Saturn-5 - ‚Äúshow is over, everybody is free!‚Äù;.

Great. One mystery is solved - got a new one. What exactly was that thing that should be delivered to the Moon? What shouldn't be left at Earth?

Maybe, that is not a question at all? Maybe, they send something, that doesn't belong to Earth?

Let's make a break. What was before space flights? Calculations, designing, inventions‚Ä¶ But in the beginning was a dream. What, excluding will, was the ground idea of space flights? Of course, meteorites, that fell from the sky . But one thing - dead lifeless stones. Humans always were in search of somebody else to contact. What outstanding happened just before start of space exploration? UFO? Again those fairy tales about aliens?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/nrgczwss1rp21.jpg

 However, there is no smoke without a fire. Were strange cases in the USA just before technological breakthrough in that area? Oh, yeah. Did something strange crashed down that in a snap was declared top secret? And just after that - breakthrough! So really were there small green men there who gave us wanted technologies? Well, where are those technologies?

What a question? We already mentioned Saturn-5 and despite efforts nobody recreated it since! It seems, aliens were here and shared their technologies with us, but just to flee from Earth. And did it so smart that we are unable to reuse them anymore. Completely reasonable regarding savages who we are, if we compare our technologies with aliens' intergalactic flights.

Now whole story looks completely different! USA not just contacted aliens, they also hid that from humankind! That also changed the nature of Moon race against Soviet Union! USSR didn't want to win, they wanted to prevent it at all. They tried to stop the USA from secret smuggling alien technologies or even aliens themselves under the cover of regular Moon trip. The failure of USSR's Moon project logically led to switching to a new program - Lunokhod that actually was designed not for the Moon exploration, but for searching of where and what Americans brought to the Moon and hid! Also that explains why Americans needed several trips and after that abrupt end of all Moon projects, including Lunokhod one. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1d9mq00y1rp21.jpg

 Russian sent Lunokhod-1 to find what americans hid. But they didn't find anything at the first site and sent another one - Lunokhod-2, preparing next one - Lunokhod-3 (that you can see now in Russian museum). When  they calculated expenses and predicted how much they need for next steps, they realized, that statistics plays against them and wrapped up the project. Really, if you hid something carefully, it‚Äôs a problem to find it. Multiply that to the rest of trips and considering nobody knows which trip was the real one...

Do you think, Russians gave up to return artefacts or aliens? No way! Russians always were devoted or even stubborn in reaching their goals

But Soviet Union collapsed and Roscosmos now not in a good shape. However, nothing is simple with Russians. Superpower USSR fell almost instantly. Who is naive enough to believe in that sort of fairy tales? Even with help of powerful Western Intelligence. Soviet KGB was able to give a huge head start to any similar Western ‚Äúfirm‚Äù. Way more realistic is planned demolition. But why?

 Let‚Äôs take a look behind, to the past. History teaches that strategy wins. You can lose a battle, but win the war. And Russian history has a lot of such examples. Kutuzov left Moscow for Napoleon's loitering

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b515e2x52rp21.jpg

 and won the war, as a winner entered Paris.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/q196bku82rp21.jpg

 For sake of the first in history socialist state Russians without any hesitation sacrificed Russian Empire. When contact with alien civilization was at stake what do you think Russian decided, considering their natural altruism? They decided to go all-in! If there is no way to find something American hid at the Moon, it's better to make Americans bring that back themselves. For sake of humanity. And that is the bet that is worth to sacrifice something significant for.

Exactly for that USSR was turned down, for the same reason they make everybody believe in their weakness and in the same time put into every important agency or company their agents (remember, exile of Soviet Jews, who, according to the unbending statistics were at the frontier everywhere, including intelligence). And eventually they reached the turning point. By the way, it is enough to mention Sergey Brin, descendant of Soviet Jews, now co owner of Google that spies on everyone in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/eonr6u3f2rp21.png

 With that sort of information it's not a rocket science for KGB and its descendant FSB to be so successful.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uqa9fq1k2rp21.jpg

 Yes, it's time to launch the plan to retrieve whatever was hid at the Moon. And Trump promised to open again the Moon program in his election speeches.

So it's pointless to search links between Trump and Putin. Putin himself a puppet of real puppet masters, skillfully control all the show. And American intelligence, indeed, overlooked real goals of Russians. Actually, it's a common among enemies of Russia. Another win‚Ä¶ As usual, Russia is at the edge of the progress leading whole mankind with her.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/be7hzosq2rp21.jpg

 By the way, take a look at the China\&amp;rsquo;s Moon program, that is so friendly to Russia recently. And notable passive Roscosmos, especially regarding new technologies development. Without any rush they are selling overstock of Soviet made rocket engines like RD-180. It\&amp;rsquo;s pointless to invest into those obsolete technologies, expecting aliens\&amp;rsquo; ones that will be returned by Russian proxy in the White House from the Moon, where cunning predecessors tried to hide from the rest of humanity. And Russia, just like USSR will be the first among all humanity in the endless way to the future. As turns out, Russia has never left that leading position.

211,"When Illuminati theories popped out around 2009 and became incredibly popular, they got laughed off and forgotten with time. Now, seeing behaviour of 90s generation I think that they could be true.",0,"When Illuminati theories popped out around 2009 and became incredibly popular, they got laughed off and forgotten with time. Now, seeing behaviour of 90s generation I think that they could be true.First of all, I would like to apologize for my bad use of tenses and English at all. I tried my best. If somebody is willing to point out some mistakes, PM me :)

Remember when Illuminati were accused of ""programming"" young people through their music videos around 2009?

Take a look at youth subculture now. I was born in 1999. From Internets point of view I can admit that we can be loosely divided into two groups. 

First is people actively participating in the internet culture, creating memes, lurking for hours on various forums and being in touch with most of new trends.
 
The second contains people who ""consume"" effects of first one, but they dont pay that much attention to ""running"" Internet culture. 

Both of them are incredibly passive compared to other generations. We are somewhat afraid of making inappropiate things. Partly because we were raised in envinroment that catches us into invisible web. When you are going to do something wrong, you instantly think that there is something that fastens the world together; if you make a protest and got yourself into jail, thanks to computers systems police stations in whole country will now be able to search about your """"crime"""" for further cases. If you spray something its very likely that CCTV will catch you and you'll be found soon. Etc. etc. The times when you could do protest in the city centre and ran away into your house without consequences no longer exists.

But... how about the rest of will to do *something*? This is incredibly gone. Nobody of my friends would even care about doing something more than legal protest. If any sort of uprise or anger occures, it ends in fucking memes or legal actions in world of social media/allowed protests. Most of my friends dont care about politics at all. 

Everybody uses the same social media, which culture is somewhat bland compared to older. We are still joking about having no hope, lots of us have depression. Being bad at life is more socially acceptable than being good; you stumble upon stupid ""i want to kill myself"" jokes everyday. If somebody dont have depression (like me. I have it too, dont accuse me of minimizing problem, because I know it exists, and how depression affects people etc.), he still jokes about it. We, 20-year olds, act like 40-50 year ones in some fields. We are filled with giant nostalgia to lots of things, including that songs from 2009.

Yeah, 2009. 2009-2012 was peak of so-called ""Illuminati"" songs. Rihanna, william, Eminem and other ones were believed to be part of this society. 

But look, how its hard to stumble upon any ""illuminati"" song in 2019. Black Eyed Peas are releasing random shit, some dead stars still record. But they dont count in big music industry anymore. 

Why? Because the operation has ended.

Generation which have basically no will to do anything and just act passively in life was raised.

Now someone could have figured out pi decimals and then created a language to decode said numbers and then passed on instructions from generation to generation putting new pieces into play far after they were needed but that is one long con.

215,The Craigslist conspiracy,0,"The Craigslist conspiracyOkay, time for something new and exciting here amidst the politics crap (and of course all the wonderful and interesting other posts that make me still come back here every day).

My wife and me have to sell a lot of our stuff right now.

How do you do it? Why, Craigslist of course!

Aside from a garage sale, which doesn't work well if you live in a more remote neighborhood. And even then, what do you do? Announce it on CL, yes.

And Craigslist is, mildly put, not very good. I'm not even talking about the 90s design. It's missing a lot of features, stuff doesn't always work well even as it should, and the site doesn't innovate at all. They don't integrate well with other software either. You have to manually re-post your stuff. It gets abused by shady businesses in a lot of ways.

And they have no competition at all in most places.

Here's an article by propaganda/advertising outlet Wired, that tells us ""ok so CL is not very good, but that's just fine and awesome actually!"" (the ""war is peace"" model I guess): https://www.wired.com/2009/08/ff-craigslist/

But what's interesting in this piece is that the founder, Craig Newman, is very enigmatic and loves to dodge questions. About his money, the share he still holds in the company, his responsibilities and decision-making power and other things.

Why is that?

Here's my theory.

If you subscribe to one of the various popular theories that say there are factions on and/or off this planet that are dependent on making people's lives miserable, does it not make perfect sense to have something like Craigslist in place? Serving the very basic need of buying and selling stuff new and used, and services of all kinds, with a local spin, but doing it in a way that creates a lot of stress and frustration and worry, and preventing others from entering the field? A project like this also comes with the awesome advantage of being a massive data collection facility.

So what if this guy Craig Newman devised the site in the 90s in Frisco, striving to make our lives better using the internet, and as it got more popular someone from the Alphabet Soup stepped in and offered him a deal he couldn't refuse, resulting in him becoming their puppet? He also seems to have a weird relationship with his CEO:

&gt; The current CEO, Jim Buckmaster, joined the site in 2000 as a programmer and handles every business and strategic issue.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; Ask Newmark about any feature you would like to see on craigslist and you will always get the same response.
&gt;
&gt; ""Ask Jim,"" he says.
&gt;
&gt; ""How do you get your feedback? Have you ever done a poll or anything like that?""
&gt;
&gt; ""The thought makes me tired. But you can suggest that to Jim if you wish.""
&gt;
&gt; ""What if Jim says no?""
&gt;
&gt; ""If you want to ask him again, you can,"" he says.
&gt;
&gt; At this point in our conversation I begin to feel the spirit of Charlie Rose upon me. After all, Newmark is the founder, a major shareholder, and the public face of the company.
&gt;
&gt; ""What would it take to get you to fire Jim?"" I ask.
&gt;
&gt; Newmark matches me mischief for mischief.
&gt;
&gt; ""Ask Jim.""

Jim is his handler? You decide.

Eager to hear your thoughts on all this.

Last night I had a reminder of their importance while potentially experiencing my own supernatural run in.  The story goes as following:

Sometime this morning around 5 A.M I lay in bed wrestling with a nightmare like I have many nights before.  It was a common theme involving an old lover playing into the disaster which was that relationship and one of my own besetting sins lust.  Except upon waking myself to terminate the annoyance, for whatever reason I stated, ""In the name of Christ Jesus, be gone.""  BOOM.  The next instance my hallway closet door crashes open while the cluttered contents come pouring out.  Still flirting with a state of mind half asleep and half alert, I shot up befuddled, listening to our dog now barking at my own bedroom door.  After darting out of the room to ensure no [A.M. stranger](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=Q82B1A1yMfQ) was lurking within, my mind turned to the coincidence.  Was it a coincidence?  Had the stacked bottled water finally lost it's battle with gravity or had a rebuked spirit pierced the veil in its haste to depart from the powerful name of Jesus our Lord?  Spooked, I went to open the Bible to see if I could flip to Psalm 23 a popular passage which I've recently taken to quoting in times of distress.  Cracking the pages the book of Psalms now lay before me.  Scanning the page my eyes locked in.  Psalm 86 verse 17.  [""Show me a sign of your favor, that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.""](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+86&amp;version=NRSVCE)  Another coincidence, serendipity, or a message from on high?  Poor packing or a defeated [succubus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus)?  While I'll let you be the judge, I do want to draw attention to a few repeated themes in Scripture.  

Peoples across time, culture, and experiences are familiar with the [Unseen Realm](https://faithlife.com/michael-heiser).  Unfortunately, many fall within the famous line, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was [convincing the world](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=EgSL3hY5iPE) he didn't exist.""  How can you defeat an enemy you're convinced doesn't even exist?  Sun Tzu stated in *The Art of War*, ‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù  Compare King David who said, [""Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God""](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+20&amp;version=NIV) or to Goliath, [‚ÄúYou come to me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of Heaven‚Äôs Armies...""](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+17&amp;version=NLT). There is power to be had gifted from [the One enthroned in heaven](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/123.htm).  

Even Jesus's disciples experienced the amazement bestowed by Him:

The seventy-two returned with joy and said, ‚ÄúLord, even the demons submit to us in your name.‚Äù  He replied, ‚ÄúI saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.  I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.  However, [do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2010&amp;version=NIV), but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.‚Äù

Yet it was not without it's own confusion.  Take for example the boy possessed by an impure spirit:

When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. ‚ÄúWhat are you arguing with them about?‚Äù he asked. A man in the crowd answered, ‚ÄúTeacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou unbelieving generation,‚Äù Jesus replied, ‚Äúhow long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.‚Äù So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. Jesus asked the boy‚Äôs father, ‚ÄúHow long has he been like this?‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom childhood,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúIt has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄòIf you can‚Äô?‚Äù said Jesus. ‚ÄúEverything is possible for one who believes.‚Äù Immediately the boy‚Äôs father exclaimed, ‚ÄúI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!‚Äù When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. ‚ÄúYou deaf and mute spirit,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI command you, come out of him and never enter him again.‚Äù The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt we drive it out?‚Äù He replied, [‚ÄúThis kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.""](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%209&amp;version=NIV)

There are many other stories demonstrating the power of God and his holy host; such as [Angel Raphael driving out the demon](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit+8&amp;version=RSVCE) Asmodeus, [Jesus of Nazareth healing the man possessed by a legion of demons](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+5&amp;version=ESV), or [Saint Paul and the slave-girl who had a spirit of divination driven from her through Jesus's name](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+16&amp;version=AMP), but for the sake of brevity I will stop here.  

So what, what's the point?  Many but at the moment it's presented itself as two fold.  One being we must remember who the enemies are and the ongoing cosmic battle.  While it's easy to let hate harden your heart and desire the cup of violence when considering any of our recent atrocities such as [Waco](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=g74LpP80w4w), [OKC](https://washingtonsblog.com/2015/04/okc.html), [9/11](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk), [Pedogate](http://archive.is/9Rwof), etc. it's imperative to put love into action.  As Saint Paul stated:

Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.  Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.  Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.  Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.  Share with the Lord‚Äôs people who are in need.  Practice hospitality.  Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.  Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.  Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.  Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.  If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.  Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God‚Äôs wrath, for it is written: ‚ÄúIt is mine to avenge; I will repay,‚Äù says the Lord.  On the contrary: ‚ÄúIf your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.  In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.‚Äù  [Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12+&amp;version=NIV)

At the same time Scripture reminds us of our duty toward the less fortunate:

Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. [Rescue the weak](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+82&amp;version=NIV) and the needy, deliver them from the hand of the wicked.  [Speak out on behalf of the voiceless, and for the rights of all who are vulnerable.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31&amp;version=CEB)  Speak out in order to judge with righteousness and to defend the needy and the poor.

Remember, we love because he first loved us.  [Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4&amp;version=NIV). For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.  And he has given us this command: anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.

Again so what, what's the point?  Here's the second fold.  If you want to be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power you must put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.  In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.  Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  The Bible doesn't just say to read the Bible but to meditate on it daily.  Like any soldier preparing for battle, one must endure the trials and tribulations in preparation for the time of testing.  [No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012)  Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

229,"England, still the greatest enemy of America.",0,"England, still the greatest enemy of America.(Sources below)

In the Colonial era, England had sponsored Creek and other Indians against the colonies. England tried to restrict the colonists east of the Appalachians so that the colonies don't become too powerful. After the Revolution, England continued to loom in the shadows by encouraging Indians to raid American territory and this became one of the causes of the war of 1812. 

During the American civil war, England supplied the Confederacy with Enfield guns and smuggling ships which may have lengthened the war for up to two years.

&gt;... substantial sections of Britain‚Äôs business elite were working with impunity to help the slave-owning southern states win the Civil War ‚Äì despite the fact that Britain was officially neutral  and had outlawed slavery almost 30 years earlier.

&gt;The entirely illegal, but tacitly British-Government-approved pro-Confederate gun-running operation is thought to have lengthened the American Civil War by up to two years ‚Äì and to have therefore cost as many as *400,000 American lives*.

Most Americans didn't like what England stood for. But around the time of the first World War public opinion flipped. Since then, mostly thanks to English propaganda, America has loved England.

Today, according to the late Lyndon LaRouche, the British are responsible for funding Democrats against Donald Trump causing a huge rift in US politics keeping Americans divided and weak. 

Please let me know your thoughts. I used to think a certain country in the Middle East was America's main enemy these days, but according to LaRouche it's England.

231,certain subreddit is ran by a pedo and censors the sub to scam on the dark web,0,"certain subreddit is ran by a pedo and censors the sub to scam on the dark webthere is a huge group of scammers that originated on forums like www.bluelight.org in the late 90's or early 2000's and is still going today. they started with the silk road when ross ulbricht came up with the idea. one of these people told on ross and after this the dark net went into an disarray. back then it was about trust and everything worked. 

this new group came together and made /d/darknetmarkets to get the markets name out there and deepdotweb.com so people can find the links. i have known about all the blue light stuff but i thought the dark web was too complicated and never looked into it for years. then when bitcoin started to gain more traction i took the plundge and it was quite easy to get into.

i used to follow the /r/darknetmarkets sub and laugh my ass off thinking it was real. i had no idea that it was a group of people playing good cop bad cop and making rival vendors who was really the same guy (think burger king mcdonalds rivalry but same guy behind both businesses acting like competition) and the subreddit was almost fully censored. 

if you went there and spoke bad about some vendor then your post would get removed. it was all really strange. for around a year or so i got really interested and got deeper into posting because i was thinking there is some strange shit going on here. i realized by the end that they were running a giant scam and listing markets on deep dot web to exit scam a huge market and then people just flood the next and it is the same business anyway. they really need have real people that sell drugs but these market owners make accounts and drop ship real vendors products and if they lose the contact they either exit scam or straight scam and they own the market so nobody knows. if people come back they just remove the post. /r/darknetmarkets was finally banned. 


i realised that i needed to make a forum. i made gangstas paradise forum. it is honestly a peice of shit and i am burning it soon but here is the link if anyone wants to check it out.

gangstas5qsooiz7.onion.ws

(anyone can see this but i would use TOR)


so just as i was about to launch this website a new website came out called dread and it is a reddit clone for the darknet. it was really nice and i instantly new they came back. when me or any people were talking about my site on reddit they were getting removed and users were getting banned in the new subs on reddit. /r/darknet even had a rule about my forum that you can not talk about it there. the other darknet sub is pretty much completely censored with the hardest filters. i was posting there fine for a while and a new mod came in and all of a sudden all talk about the forum was banned. 

i was asking deepdotweb.com if my forum could be listed. i had no idea they were in on the scam at the time. and they just kept saying wait some time. finally after 4 months they said sure we can put you on now. they put us on and then instantly took us off claiming an uproar in the darknet. he told me that hugbunter the owner of dread didn't want it. i said a few harsh words about the guy for making me look bad on my forum about him and hugbunter and he made a lie on deep dot web that we promote cp on the forum and people should avoid it.

(just a note i fuck hot chicks)

after this i start to realise that in actuality the owner of deepdotweb is a pedo fag. he actually brought the website out as a cp news website that got famous after the playpen scandel. he follows me around everywhere on his daily users bitching about my forum. you can look at my post history to see it. i found his other user and he is always browsing /r/teenagers and even offering money to sexual acts with them. 

Proof- https://linx.li/pedofag.png

now here is the catch with deepdotweb and dread. i told you about the good cop bad cop. well they are a group of scammers so they are not trustworthy. dread has another site call darkwebnews and it is a competing site to deepdotweb. he knows this and gets angry. yesterday they were trying to promote it alot. i went and looked at his sub reddit which i have not looked in a while because i am banned and it sucks now this mod is in charge. the top post is talkign shit about dread.

so i go there just now and this is what i see.

&gt;Be very careful with Dreddit the forum that claims to be a place to speak openly about the darkweb. 

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/1pHm7sp.png 


this is the top post on a sub that has 120,470 subscribers. It is a guy who went to a darknet forum and wanted to post about cp but they removed it and it has almost 50 upvotes. i read the rules of this forum so i am not posting the subreddit but reddit needs to do something about this shit because it is fucking sick first off and second off scaming users non stop.

237,I think trump is in collusion with aliens who want to take over the planet.,0,"I think trump is in collusion with aliens who want to take over the planet.TL;DR Trump is making a deal with Russia to sacrifice Mexico and Central America to an alien force bent on taking over the world.  

I‚Äôve believed this for a long time, for some reason it just makes sense to me. Anyway, I also believe that he‚Äôs making some kind of deal with Russia (who‚Äôs in on all this with the aliens and might have some supervisory role to trump), to sacrifice the people living in Mexico and Central America. 

It‚Äôs an admittedly out there explanation for why he‚Äôs so obsessed with the border... however if people are fleeing Central America in massive numbers this alien invasion may be why. I‚Äôm not saying that there are spaceships in Guatemala right now; just that someone or some force is really trying hard to drive people north as fast as possible, and also why trump is enforcing border security with zero tolerance... it could be that the resistance to the aliens is coming from Central America somehow. 

Remember a border ‚Äúshut down‚Äù is not a closure. It just means that every single person and thing is inspected... so maybe there is a reason he wants the extra scrutiny. 

It just somehow fits all these outsize reactions he has to things coming through the border that he can ‚Äúsee‚Äù and the rest of us can‚Äôt. Something keeps triggering him, hard - and he‚Äôs a strong willed individual. I can‚Äôt believe that any of his advisors are ‚Äútriggering‚Äù his behavior, and I also can‚Äôt believe that he would consider himself less powerful than anyone else on earth... but against a superior alien force? I could see him definitely colluding/collaborating in that situation. 

Anyway, of course I‚Äôm probably wrong, this is just the stuff that kicks around in my head.

Over the last 10 years the US has tried to 'pick winners'. It has been a disaster.Legacy: 

Obama came to the White House to shouts of ""yes we can."" But on numerous issues, he leaves office on a ""no he couldn't"" note. That's nowhere more true than it is with his bold promises to fundamentally transform the nation's energy and transportation industries.

He promised a vast network of high-speed rail, a ""smart"" electric grid, a million electric cars on the roads, a ""clean energy economy"" creating millions of new green jobs. And he spent lavishly to realize this dream. But as he leaves office, Obama has little to show taxpayers for all of their money he's poured into these efforts.

Roads: 

Obama's stimulus included more than $105 billion for what he called the ""largest new investment in America's infrastructure since President Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System."" Not only would this massive spending on ""shovel ready"" projects create jobs, he said it would reduce congestion and save 14,000 lives a year.

But all that money made almost no difference in the quality of the nation's roads, bridges airports and other infrastructure. The grade given by American Society of Civil Engineers for the state of the nation's overall infrastructure when from a ""D"" to a ""D+."" In other words, it went from poor to only slightly less poor. And the Transportation Department reports that highway congestion is worse now than it was in 2009.

Electric cars: 

Obama said he'd put a million electric cars on the road by investing massively in battery technology while heavily subsidizing the cars themselves with a generous tax credit. In 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the price tag for Obama's dream would be nearly $8 billion over 10 years. But electric car sales have consistently underwhelmed, leaving the nation nowhere near that 1 million mark. Electric cars remain a tiny niche market heavily subsidized by millions of taxpayers who have no interest in owning one.

High-speed rail: 

Early in his administration, Obama fantasized about creating a network of high-speed rail lines across the country. He poured $8 billion worth of stimulus money into the project, hoping to get rail lines started in 10 regions. Only one has seriously pursued Obama's dream ‚Äî California ‚Äî which got $3.5 billion in federal grants. But its effort is foundering amid skyrocketing costs and endless construction delays.

Renewable energy: 

Obama spent billions of taxpayer dollars subsidizing windmills and solar plants as part of his vision of a ""clean energy"" future. But despite his repeated claims about a huge increase in renewable energy production, renewables today make up just 11% of the nation's total energy production, according to the Energy Information Administration. In mid-1983, the share of energy production comprised of renewables was ‚Ä¶ 11%. The biggest shift in energy under Obama came not from a government program, but from fracking, which vastly expanded the supply of domestic oil and natural gas.

Smart grid: 

Obama pushed aggressively for a ""smart electric grid,"" that could better manage electricity use. But a 2016 report from the Manhattan Institute finds that this push has also made the nation's power grid more vulnerable to cyberattack. ""The push for 'greener' and 'smarter' grids requires far greater grid-Internet connectivity to ensure the continuous delivery of electricity,"" notes the report's author, Mark Mills. ""These greener, smarter grids will involve a vast expansion of the Internet of Things that greatly increases the cyberattack surface available to malicious hackers and hostile nation-state entities.""

252,Rapper Nipsey Conspiracy,0,"Rapper Nipsey ConspiracyI‚Äôm sure most of us have seen tons of posts about this already, and I just want to throw in my two cents.

There‚Äôs speculation that this rapper was killed, by TPTB, for working on a documentary on Dr. Sebi; a man who claimed to have a cure for AIDs and promoted healthy wisdoms. In addition, the rapper was a strong black community member that worked on unification and renovation, so there‚Äôs always a possibility that he was killed because of it. There is also speculation that this rapper was killed due to gang violence. Personally, it‚Äôs hard to say anything for certain.

I never heard of him or his work until now, and I‚Äôm sure the evil elite wouldn‚Äôt want to draw attention to Dr. Sebi or the promotion of strong communities and unification. I‚Äôm sure they plan assassinations and they don‚Äôt just kill anyone because they ‚Äúknow‚Äù the truth or because they‚Äôre active community members. It raises too many questions, and as you can see it‚Äôs causing a lot of unwanted attention. 

Crazy pitch, but hear me out. When we use terms like the ‚Äúelite‚Äù, I assume most of us think of a group that is made up of selfish, psychopathic people that want control and power over anyone who isn‚Äôt them. What if, there are other elites who actually do care for humanity and oppose the evil elitists? What if these two factions are the symbolic fight of Good vs Evil?

Now, what if this group sacrifices people, but it‚Äôs for the greater good? I was totally unaware of Dr. Sebi‚Äôs work, and it took this man‚Äôs life for me to become conscious of Dr. Sebi. This death is also promoting giving back to the community and unification. Is it possible that man was sacrificed by the ‚Äúgood‚Äù elite for these reasons? I mean, his family will be provided for; and I know, no amount of money can replace a father/husband, but they will be taken care of finically. 

This death also reminds me of that other rapper X, except he supposedly sold his soul. He has a song about making a deal with the devil. He promoted ‚ÄúTeam Satan 666‚Äù. X was sacrificed (allegedly) too, but it was all about the money. I barely knew about the rapper until his death. His songs became the most streamed on multiple platforms. Imagine how much money his label got after. 

On a side note; I‚Äôm starting to see the logic in Trump supporters and Q. What if Trump is actually on our side and is working for the ‚Äúgood‚Äù elite? I still think it‚Äôs unlikely, but after thinking about it and writing this post I see how it‚Äôs possible to think that. 

Sorry if this post was all over the place, but the claims that Nipsey was killed by the ‚Äúevil‚Äù elite didn‚Äôt make sense to me. As I said up above, there‚Äôs a lot of unwanted attention that is being generated. I also believe the elite run simulations with supercomputers before proceeding with anything so they can get an idea of what the most probable outcome is.

263,Decades Old Cold Case Murder of Washington DC Senate Staffer Never Solved,0,"Decades Old Cold Case Murder of Washington DC Senate Staffer Never SolvedRaymond ""Nels"" Nelson was from Rhode Island and a former bureau chief of the Providence Journal newspaper.  He became a DC Strategist when he helped then unknown Democratic politician Claiborne Pell (known for the College Pell Grants) become a US Senator.  After the election, he worked for Pell as an Administrative Assistant.  The married father of three's political rise would stall as he came out as gay in 1976.  His lifestyle was frowned upon by many in the DC establishment.  He did become a  staff member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.  In 1981 Nelson was found murdered in his residence on Quincey Street.  He had been beaten to death with one of his own typewriters.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some Friends of Nelson have an idea of a possible suspect but feel that political pressure has prevented an arrest.  Did Nelson know something he shouldn't have?   Was he involved in a relationship with someone powerful who was afraid that if it got out that it could damage their career?   Who and why was Raymond Nelson murdered?

How did I get the book ?:

&amp;#x200B;

Searching the internet, I found a topic here on this same subreddit, from two months ago, where one of the comments asked to get in touch with a man named Michael Weaver, since I do not live in the United States, I preferred to send an email, Michael replied quickly, this is his message:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Yes, I met Mr. Thomas in the 1960's when he was a guest on a talk radio show in Kansas City, Missouri.  At that time, the book he had that he brought with him and that I got a copy of was like a thirty page pamphlet, not really 'a book'.  I spent several hours conversing with Mr. Thomas and skimmed through his 'book' which I put away for safe keeping and then later lost in a flooded basement in the early '70's.*

*In the mid' 80's I began trying to find a copy, but to no avail.  I had been impressed with the description of a cataclysm - what Mr. Thomas called 'a tumble' but I could not well remember the details and was hoping to find a copy so I could better relate to others what he was explaining.  I contacted book stores near and far, but again, to no avail.  Sometime around the turn of the century, after I got 'interneted', I began searching again, and low and behold, a bookstore in England had a copy of a 'book' by Chan Thomas entitled 'The Adam And Eve Story'  I immediately ordered it, as was astounded when I received an actual paper back book of over two hundred pages, divided into two sections: The Adam and Eve Story, 127 pages and Aftermath of The Adam and Eve Story, 85 pages.  This book is a First Edition that was published by Bengal Tiger Press in 1993 and is much more comprehensive than the short pamphlet I had possessed those many years earlier.  I set about to cull from those over 200 pages the basic description of what a cataclysm is, and that small bit is what I posted on the blog that you must have read.  I recently had another person contact me, wanting the same info as you and I scanned the most of it into PDF file and sent to him, as I will for you.  Happy Reading...     Oh, and I don't know Anything about it ever having been 'classified info' though if it was, I guess it doesn't surprise me...  I'm not very good a computer stuff - I had difficulty in sending the last two sections - when you get it all put together, if there are pages missing or unreadable, let me know and I will try to make it right.  Glad to see the interest growing - so Please Share and keep Chan's works alive.  And keep me informed as you go along to what is happening with this amazing info.""*

286,"Since we were talking about ""The Adam and Eve Story: The History of Cataclysms,"" let's talk about the shifting poles and Earth's weakening magnetosphere.",0,"Since we were talking about ""The Adam and Eve Story: The History of Cataclysms,"" let's talk about the shifting poles and Earth's weakening magnetosphere.Regardless of your opinions on crustal displacement, we are seeing strong evidence of a pole reversal in current times. Moreover, we are seeing a correlation between rapid pole movement and the weakening of Earth's magnetic field, which is what protects us from a plethora of radiation and electromagnetic forces. This could be extremely dangerous for our species. Solar flares seem to be particularly dangerous during this period of weakened protection. 

Solar flares are measured by a series of numbers and letters. There are weaker solar storms than M or X class, but I'll be focusing on those for this comment. 

- M1 is fairly weak. 

- X1 is ten times stronger than M1.

- X10 is ten times stronger than X1 and 100 times stronger than M1.

- X100 is ten times stronger than X10, 100 times stronger than X1, and 1000 times stronger than M1.

Take the Carrington Event of 1859. It is estimated that this solar storm was anywhere from an X35-X45. Intense auroras were seen, the entire planet went without power for 12-24 hours, and the entirety of Earth's telegraph system was instantly fried. Telegraph operators actually suffered burns as a result of this event. It was a substantial solar storm, and the effects are obvious, but it would have been far worse by today's standards. In a time where all of your money is electronic, where virtually everyone's mode of transportation relies on one form of electricity or another, where communication and shelter rely on electricity, and the population of the world has fucktupled, we would be far worse off if struck by a similar storm. Luckily, when the Carrington Event happened, we had little reliance on electricity and a strong magnetic field. 

As recently as 50 years ago (heck, even 20 years ago), we were handling X-class solar flares with minimal to no disruption. Fast forward to the past decade, where we have seen a drastic acceleration of the poles shifting and a corresponding weakening of the magnetic field, and even storms as weak as M5-M9 have caused measurable ground and atmospheric disruption, such as transformers exploding, navigation technology going haywire causing the grounding of flights, strange weather patterns, and a variety of other electrical mishaps. In other words, weaker and weaker solar flares are having greater and greater effects on our planet and grid. 

If the trend of the weakening magnetosphere continues as the poles continue to shift, X-class solar flares could devastate our power grid and lead to a damn near apocalyptic scenario. No more food on shelves after 48 hours. Utter chaos in the streets. Governments would be unable to control the chaos as their tools for doing so would be reduced to analog technology. These are just the immediate dangers. Radiation would seep into our atmosphere and undoubtably affect us and the wildlife in ways that are difficult to predict. Billions would die. 

Couple this with the periodic rise and fall of activity in our sun. Our sun's magnetosphere offers us protection as well. Right now the sun's magnetosphere is also seeing a declining trend. Moreover, within the next couple generations our solar system is expected to move out of a magnetically charged cloud of dust that is also offering us protection. It's like a trifecta of weakening protections threatening to plunge us into more cosmic radiation than our species has ever known. Absolutely crazy shit. 

A great source to get you started. Entire channel is constantly researching this topic.

There are a lot of theories about the next mass extinction event, what will cause it, and how urgent it is. Some will tell you climate change, others will say general pollution and overpopulation, some will say nuclear war, some will say crazy huge asteroid colliding with earth.

290,So i think i figured out.....,0,"So i think i figured out.....Yesterday I got high on some stimualnts and somehow got into a conversation with a buddy about artist now a days popping up over night, mainly rap but stuff surrounding today's music is odd. Then again maybe we were just high but either way it's a pretty wild and interesting threoy I came up with. Bear with me its alot to take in so lol. Okay 2000s music was in my opinion very good and different then alot of other, between 2000-2013 is about where I gonna say this is, anyways everything was equally on the radio and flavored people's type they listened too and it was all good and felt like everyone in America had a song they liked and I'm talking mostly Country, Rap, Rock, Pop and a short but out of nowhere dubstep wave that died. Okay here's when stuff got different but I dont think most people really realized it. After dubstep fell out completely around 2015, rap all of sudden became hugley diverse almost overnight and soon enough everyone started creating it, mainly pop stars like rihanna, Beyonce, never heard rock, county, ect and when I say that I main yeah it was around but you had to search around if you wanted to hear new stuff, wasn't really openly advertised or talked about as much. So back to the rap, overnight you had not only the whole country slowly becoming a fan towards American rap music but the world. Rap mutanted into subgroups like trap, emo, club, banger, styles of rapping, openly gay rappers, gangster, screamo, dance mixed rap verses with pop hooks, politically, odd, just plain stupid (long neck) and all kinds of white rappers were slowing taking over in areas. Now here was what I think was a big change that was planned, ""Mumble rap"" came out which was literally just saying slangs and popular things the kids were saying but in fact where obviously violent , drug, crime and so on along with face tattoos becoming a fad with everyone...this is not good. Around that time...that's when alot of shootings were happening and they've always have but America would unknowingly start to expect these shootings and become a normal thing like a car wreck and there young people are manily the victims with all the same stuff, doing rap, face tattoos and ect but no one really said anything cause it was brainwashing EVERYONE. Look at it like this, lil pumps lyrics are not good and are just mouth sounds and drug,gun related stuff but his and other artsits songs where somehow In commericals, hollywood movies, advertised through numerous products, memes, soical media, I could go on and even people who didn't even like it eventually started singing the songs under their breath, there catchy and beats we're becoming as popular as the slang, GANG GANG, SKIIIRRRRT, FUCK 12, ON GOD, ect. 
Ok now this how I believe shit got out fast and when I came up with this main theroy
I'm pretty sure you heard of a Industry Plant
I haven't before this 
Well if ya don't a Industry Plant is a Artist of entertainment that the government or whoever (Illuminati) payed or sold their soul for instant fame to pull in more fans however they do It, whether it be a hot female, emo rapper, disability or whatever someone could connect with. Okay so I thought of baby goth. Shes a new rap artist with face tattoos and is assiocated with others just like her. Well Dou Re Me Fa So..a song I've heard everywhere for weeks before I even know who baby goth was was this girls song and no where do I remember hearing by baby goth or baby goths new song check it out. It was like they used sublimated messageing by playing it but never really openly said who sung it. So I did some research on baby goth and her being asccused of a Industry Plant was first to  come up but not only that, but not really any info or pics was anywhere about her. Its like if someone bought a random girl where ever they found her, sat her down whoever she was and offered a deal....fame, money, everything you want like most humans. Only thing is your born again, new name, new person. Now you have baby goth I fresh rap artist who can relate to all kinds but has face tattoos, lyrics with drugs and satanism overlays but everybody from teachers to kids to seniors wouldn't even point it out but would often say I like her she's different or I like the beat and I think it's caused this plan of music weaponry through brain washing for years though media and entertainment and basically what everyone does now a days through there phone has worked. Don't know why, maybe it's to shape and form a generation or make violence more accepted or crime and drugs to be a cool thing to get more control of something. I dont know there's a million reasons or like I said maybe I'm just high and sound hella crazy üòÄüòÜ

It is actually trained and not just trained but encouraged!Believe it or not but it is one man that is responsible for this fear based police training. He is a cancer that was left to fester by being allowed to go from police station to police station for years pretending to be a war hero that "" is the leading police shooting and survival specialist"" in America. His name is David Grossman. And most Americans have never heard of him. He has made millions. He classifies humans as sheep, sheepdogs and wolves. This man teaches police to kill and not police.

He famously says during these mandatory police trainings that after killing someone he went home and had the best sex in his life and that they should also do it. He is the one responsible for the fear statement, better you going home to your wife and kids then the perp. He is let into police stations to teach them what he calls the mentality of a warrior and that they should immediately use lethal force rather than be sorry later. He tells the police not to worry and that the top brass always have their back. Which sadly has become the standard. Calls his training killology He is the one that convinced the president that video games are responsible for all these shootings, which the president duly regurgitated

Well now you can help figure it out!The book is about crustal displacement, but not the one you may be familiar with. It is also about compressed episodic magnetic pole flips, where the poles flip back and forth on very brief time-scales. The book is highly speculative and highly entertaining.

The CIA link: 

https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp79b00752a000300070001-8

The CIA banned the book in 1996. Chan Thomas was the fake name of the writer. When the book was re-released in 2013, it was missing 57 pages. It says so right at the bottom of the CIA'S own webpage.

Bright Insight released an excellent introductory video on this very subject. It's 25 minutes long and very well presented.

Suspicious Observers also released a more in-depth speculative video of this subject, well worth the watch. It's an excellent 25 minute video.

What I want is your opinion on what those missing pages may have contained. Are there any real conspiracy theorists here anymore? Or, is it all just politics now?

I remember the old days when journalists did news not politics.

Thank you for your consideration.

There are multiple ways for this world to end. One often ignored and downplayed is the fact that men are becoming infertile and becoming bio-feminized. We are also getting stupider and going crazy because of mulltiple simultaneous environmental threats.

6 In my distress I called to the Lord;I cried to my God for help.From his temple he heard my voice;my cry came before him, into his ears.7 The earth trembled and quaked,and the foundations of the mountains shook;they trembled because he was angry.8 Smoke rose from his nostrils;consuming fire came from his mouth,burning coals blazed out of it.9 He parted the heavens and came down;dark clouds were under his feet.10 He mounted the cherubim and flew;he soared on the wings of the wind.11 He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him‚Äîthe dark rain clouds of the sky.12 Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced,with hailstones and bolts of lightning.13 The Lord thundered from heaven;the voice of the Most High resounded.14 He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy,with great bolts of lightning he routed them.15 The valleys of the sea were exposedand the foundations of the earth laid bareat your rebuke, Lord,at the blast of breath from your nostrils.

Was Abdelsoud a CIA agent all along?

Sorry for the formatting, it's from a pdf..

""Zawahiri's guide in the  United  States was a singular figure in  the  history  of  espionage, Ali  Abdelsoud  Mohammed.  Six-foot-one,  two  hundred  pounds,  and  exceptionally  fit,  Mohammed  was  a  martial artist  and  a  skilled  linguist  who  spoke  fluent  English,  French,  and  Hebrew  in  addition  to his native  Arabic. When the Egyptian Army cashiered him, Zawahiri gave him the daunting task of penetrating American intelligence.

 In 1984 Mohammed boldly walked into the Cairo station of the CIA to  offer  his  services. The  officer  who  assessed  him  decided  he  was  probably  a plant  by  Egyptian intelligence; however,  he  cabled  other  stations and headquarters  to see if there was any interest.  The Frank-furt  station, which hosted  the Iranian office  of the  agency,  responded,  and soon Ali found  himself in Hamburg  as a novice intelligence man. He entered  a mosque associated with Hezbollah and immediately  told  the  Iranian cleric in charge that he was an American  spy assigned to infiltrate  the community.  He didn't  realize that the agency had already penetrated  the mosque; his declaration was immediately  reported.  

The  CIA says that it terminated  Mohammed,  sent out  cables label-ing  him  highly untrustworthy,  and  placed  him  on  the  State  Depart-ment watch list to prevent him from entering the United  States. By that time, however, Mohammed was already in California on a visa-waiver program  that  was  sponsored  by  the  agency  itself,  one  designed  to  shield  valuable  assets or  those  who  have  performed  important  ser-vices  for  the  country.  In order  to  stay in  the  United  States, he  would  need  to  become  a  citizen,  so he  married  a  California  woman,  Linda  Sanchez, a medical technician, whom  he met on the transatlantic flight to the United States. A year after  Mohammed  arrived, he returned  to his military career, this time as an enlisted man in the  U.S. Army. He managed to get sta-tioned  at  the  John  F. Kennedy  Special Warfare  Center  and  School at Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina.  Even  though  he  was  only  a  supply  sergeant, Mohammed  made  a remarkable  impression, gaining a spe-cial commendation  from his commanding officer  ""for exceptional  per-formance"" and winning fitness awards in competition  against some of the  most  highly  trained  soldiers  in  the  world.  His  awed  superiors  found  him ""beyond reproach"" and ""consistently accomplished."" Perhaps  the  secret  to  preserving  his  double  identity  was  that  he  The Silicon  Valley  never  disguised  his  beliefs.  He  began  each  morning  with  dawn  prayers, followed by a long run while listening on his Walkman  to  the  Quran, which he was trying to memorize. He cooked his own meals to make sure they  followed  Islamic dietary rules. In addition  to his mili-tary duties, he was pursuing a doctorate  in Islamic studies. The Amer-ican army was so respectful  of his views that it asked him to help teach a  class  on  Middle  East politics  and  culture  and  to  make  a  series of videotapes  explaining  Islam  to  his  fellow  soldiers.  According  to  Mohammed's  service  records,  he  ""prepared  and  executed  over  40  country  orientations  for  teams  deploying to  the  Middle East/'  Mean-time, he was slipping maps and training manuals off base to downsize and copy at Kinko's. He used these  to write the multivolume  terrorist  training  guide  that  became  al-Qaeda's  playbook.  

On  weekends  he  commuted to Brooklyn and Jersey City, where he trained Muslim mili-tants  in  military  tactics.  Among  them  were  members   of  al-Jihad,  including el-Sayyid  Nosair, a  fellow  Egyptian who  would  kill Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Jewish extremist, in 1990. In  1988 Mohammed  casually informed  his superior  officers that he was  taking  some  leave  time  to  go  ""kill  Russians"" in  Afghanistan.  When he came back, he showed  off a couple  of belt buckles he said he . took  from  Soviet  soldiers he  killed  in  ambush.  In  fact,  he  had  been  training the  first al-Qaeda volunteers in techniques  of  unconventional  warfare, including kidnappings, assassinations, and hijacking planes, which he had learned from  the American Special Forces. Mohammed  left  active military service in  1989 and joined the U.S. Army  Reserve. He and his wife  settled  in the  Silicon Valley 

He  man-aged to hold a job as a security guard (for a defense contractor that was developing a triggering device for the Trident missile system) despite the fact that he sometimes disappeared  for months, ostensibly to  ""buy  rugs""  in  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan.  Meanwhile,  he  continued  his  attempts to penetrate American intelligence. He had applied  for a posi-tion as a translator at both the CIA and the FBI while in North Carolina. Then  in  May  1993, an  FBI agent  in  San  Jose  named  John  Zent  approached  Mohammed,  inquiring  about  the  trade  in  fake  driver's  licenses.  Still  hoping   to   get   recruited   by  American  intelligence,  

Mohammed  steered  the  conversation  toward  radical  activities  in  a  local  mosque,  and  he  told  some  eye-opening  tales  about  fighting  the  Soviets  in  Afghanistan.  Because  of  the  military  nature  of  these  revelations, Zent  contacted  the  Department of Defense, and a team of 181  counterintelligence  specialists  from  Fort  Meade,  Maryland,  came  to  San Jose to talk to Mohammed.  They spread  out  maps  of Afghanistan on the floor of Zent's office, and Mohammed  indicated the  mujahideen  training  camps. 

 He  mentioned  the  name  of  Osama  bin  Laden,  who  Mohammed   said  was  preparing  an  army  to  knock  off  the  Saudi  regime.  Mohammed   also  spoke  about   an  organization,  al-Qaeda,  which was operating training camps in Sudan. He even admitted  that  he was providing the members instruction  in hijacking and espionage. The  interrogators  apparently  made  nothing  of  these  revelations.  It  would  be  three  critical years before  anyone  else in American  intelli-gence would  hear of al-Qaeda.""",1,ignor or collus,ignor or collus the follow text is from the loom tower by lawrenc

So, as most of us should know, porn can be a weapon and addiction is very easy to fall into. 

Israel, supposedly, used porn against Palestine as psychological warfare.

I feel like it‚Äôs common knowledge (in this community as at least) that mindgeek owns a majority of porn companies. If you watched any porn within the past year or more, you‚Äôll see this sudden rise of incest related material. 

So, I had a moment of weakness and was stressed, so I decided to be a hedonist and pleasure myself. I was curious to see what the ‚ÄúMost Viewed‚Äù of ‚ÄúAll Time‚Äù, and the whole page was infested with incest videos. I was taken back a little because I didn‚Äôt expect these newish videos to conquer the classics. 

Is the popularization of this genre caused by novelty? Or is there a malicious agenda that‚Äôs being fulfilled? If you believe in the latter, then what are your thoughts on it? 

I think it‚Äôs to normalize incest and boost the numbers of children that are born with deficiencies due to interbreeding sex.

The City of London situated within the city called London is actually the original London. However, to make things clearer, we need to go back nearly 2,000 years in history, to when the Romans invaded Britain and founded the settlement of Londinium.

Westminster was built nearby with the purpose of competing with the powerful City of London and this was when the second London was born. The new city expanded rapidly and it eventually surrounded the City of London. By 1889 the County of London was formed and the name was more often used for the larger area that surrounded the original City of London.

The City of London continued functioning independently, governed by a Corporation even after 1965, when the County of London and the County of Middlesex were abolished and Greater London was formed. The mayor of Greater London has nothing to do with the original City of London, which still has separate governing bodies and a mayor.

In fact, the City of London is so independent that it has its own flag, crest, police force, ceremonial armed forces, and a mayor who has a special title, the Right Honorable, the Lord Mayor of London. Oddly enough, if the monarch wants to enter the City of London, she first must ask the Lord Mayor for permission.

This  interview with David Berkowitz (Son of Sam, and also includes some very interesting opinions of Police investigators) seems to finally explain the baffling actions of that  man. It certainly has made me think there is some truth to his claims. I  tried to read up on this case and bits and pieces seem to be consistent  with what he is saying. He claims the SOS murders were the result of  several people, and the witness statements really do vary hugely and imply more than one person. He doesn't deny  responsibility and says he deserves to be locked up forever. He says even though he was involved in some killings he was to take the heat for a cult called The Process that was mainly responsible for these killings. He mentions that The Process had animal sacrifices  at a particular park, of German Shepherds. This is true, there were  mutilated dogs of that type found at the park where they were based, and  The Process Church has admitted to focusing on this animal, but they say, in a loving way. David famously originally claimed that a  neighbours dog told him to kill people.

Animal sacrifices (German Shepherds, the worshiped dogs of The Process) in Untermyer Park -  [https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ritualistic-sacrifice-and-the-son-of-sam-satan-worshiping-in-america-s-greatest-forgotten-garden](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ritualistic-sacrifice-and-the-son-of-sam-satan-worshiping-in-america-s-greatest-forgotten-garden)

What people may not  realise, is that the owner of David Berkowitz's next door dog does seem was a member of a cult, which seems to have been The Process as Berkowitz says so ( see [here](https://unsolved.com/gallery/son-of-sam/) and [here](https://forums.sherdog.com/threads/did-the-son-of-sam-really-act-alone-or-was-he-a-member-of-a-murderous-satanic-cult.3749461/page-3) ) and that he owned a distinctive yellow car matching one ID'd as moving fast away from one of the SOS killings. 

The Process cult originated in a rich suburb of London. It has apparently changed its identity. More oddities (my observation) - the Process used a very similar symbol to the Zodiac killers symbol on their literature, and I recall also that version was used in one image, also he was never caught, and the MO and targets of The Zodiac looks similar to David Berkowitz - Young healthy people and couples are senselessly targeted. The Process changed identity and moved  from the west coast allegedly eastwards and as they moved east, it has  been speculated they could tie in with other killers.

They have since disappeared without trace, except the female founder established an animal sanctuary in Utah, but are believed by some to have set up under a new identity.

For some more info on the SOS cultlink, this is 

Although tenuous, I believe there could be connections with other unsolved murders. The so-called  'Smiley Face' killer was a hypothesised serial killer that similarly  targets young, cream of the crop type students who were disposed in rivers and lakes. Certain indications are that most of those deaths,  occurring along the Interstate 94 corridor around the Great Lakes, are not natural and do seem to be murders, though once a drunk person goes missing, and later turns up in the water, it will almost always be  presumed as accidental. There is a detailed analysis by an ex cop and a  university criminologist called Case Studies in Drowning Forensics that  builds a strong case for the unnatural nature and demographics of these  deaths. And they support that this was likely the work of a group. At many of the deaths strange 'smiley face' graffiti was often found.  Whilst likely a coincidence, the retire Police officers who took up the  case on behalf of the parents states that the smiley faces they  identified at the hypothesised dumping points were not alike, were distinctive and are tags of specific gangs. One of the smiley faces has a  Zodiac style cross on the forehead, and, this cross was also carved into Charles Mansons forehead before he later converted it into a swastika. Charles Manson also appears to have connections to The Process, two members of which apparently visited him in Jail, after which Charles made an abrupt change in some of the things he was saying. A very loose connection therefore can be made between the symbols used by Manson and the Zodiac, and the claimed visitors of Manson in jail, The Process.

Although a few of the Smiley Face victims show definite signs of murder, the use of a drug like GHB or Scopolamine was not tested, except when the test was  specifically requested by the authors of Drowning Forensics, they then did indeed show suspicious levels of GHB.

It has been  suggested that slightly inebriated men had either their drinks spiked,  or were lured perhaps with women into a van, later drugged, perhaps  killed in a bath tub, and dumped in rivers. It appears to be the result of a group, which suggests a cult.

The forensic  evidence for these deaths include the fact that all are of a specific  age group, where, based on the demographics of alcohol drinkers, only  26% should be. The fact that most of these deaths occur in the winter,  spring and autumn, which is very rare, few people lark about on the  water except in the summer; in some cases they come from the same town  and frequented the same bars; the bodies turned up in the water floating face up, but nearly all males float face down after any length of time  according to the texts, which suggests they have been moved from land  after death, ligature marks on the neck, empty hands whereas natural  drownings the hands often are clutching weeds and show certain injuries  from thrashing, rigor mortis which always passes after a few days, yet  these men are going missing 2-3 weeks prior, and show virtually no  degradation, fly larvae that are of a house fly species and only lay on  land, the GHB and more besides. One victim was last seen staggering down  the road being followed by a car which stopped everytime the victim  staggered, which several witnesses reported as very suspicious.

Something similar may be happening in the UK. There are now 60 young  men, and it is exclusively men, pulled out of Manchester canals in the  last few years. Parents consider the deaths suspicious and have dubbed  the speculated killer as the Manchester Pusher. Police have not  supported these claims in any way and have not apparently even  considered it seriously.

# Let Us Prepare For The Climate Challenges We Face

Through years of research I have concluded with empirical evidence that we as a society have been lied to about the very nature of our being, the planet, the solar system, and the universe as a whole. In other words life as we know it is a 100% agenda driven folly. Our intellect and general understanding of things have been manipulated by subversive forces for hundreds of years.

The data consolidated within this report will most assuredly not be taken lightly by the masses and will most likely be shunned by many. Let it be shown that this is at what level of ignorance society has fallen. As Henry Ford said so eloquently, a society of ""functioning illiterates"".

The following are cycles of life that cannot be avoided. These cycles are not fully understood with regard to how, when, where and why by modern science. In this thesis we will discuss the life giving cycles of the sun and it's effect on mankind, the planet, and the solar system, finally showing how the sun reacts to the surrounding universe and it's inhabitants.

I will discuss how society can prepare for these cycles through the knowledge of the ancients using historical evidence of the past as a source of looking into the future and knowing what markers to look for. Understanding these records is of the utmost importance if we are to prepare for the future. The correct planning and preparation will give mankind a higher percentage of survivability during these natural, cyclical, challenging times ahead of us.

The sun, giver of life, was the focal point of many ancient culture structures. We find this evident in the inscriptions left behind on tablets, precious metal, wood, stone, papyrus, clay pots and figurines. They planned everyday of their lives according to the disposition of the sacred solar disk. This allowed them to plan for the future as they understood the cycles of the sun.

Through hundreds of years of study they understood with certainty that the sun went through changes and subsequently presented them with challenges on a cyclical timeline. They kept records and understood that by looking at the past they could prepare for future events.

On a mundane level the sun has an 11yr cycle of high and low sunspot activity. It is recorded that while the sun is at it's minimum point there are more natural disruptions on the planet that ultimately affect our daily lives. This rather mundane 11yr cycle exists within longer cycles that can last for up to thousands of years. We have no idea how far out this long count goes. What we do know is that according to written texts of the last 3000 years the sun has also gone into longer states of minimum (minimum solar sun spots) that lasts for decades at fluctuating times. These are called Grand Solar Minimum periods. The mundane 11yr cycle (MC) is within this Grand Solar Minimum cycle (GSM).

As we glean information from the historical record we see GSM's occur cyclically, roughly every 100+- years with every fourth GSM being of longer duration than the others, thus creating another 400yr cycle.

When we consider the 25,772 year procession of the equinoxes, which coincidentally aligns with the Mayan calendar, we can draw a panorama of cyclical patterns of endless timelines. With this understanding it would be easy to now hypothesize that there are massive universal cycles at play here. All of which affect life on our planet.

To help the reader wrap ones head around this I have included graphs linked below which ¬†will help to illustrate the science.

\#1/ Here is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:SpaceEnvironmentOverview_From_19830101.jpg), notice the top of the graph how it shows the rounding scale of the mundane 11yr cycle.

\#2/ This [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Sunspots_11000_years.svg) gives us almost 12k years of sunspot activity. Notice how thousands of years ago the sun was much more active and that we are without a doubt sliding downward as we enter the 21st century.

\#3/ Here is another [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Solar_Cycle_Prediction.gif) showing the mundane 11yr cycle and how this 24th cycle we currently reside, there are fewer sunspots than previous cycles and the same downward trend indicated in the previous graph. (update 3/30/2019, we are now headed upward into solar cycle 25. Predictably there should be an increase in sunspot activity for the next 5 1/2 years until we turn downward once again. It is predicted that SC 25 will not exceed in solar activity compared to previous cycles. It is thought that it will indeed be greatly diminished allowing even more comic ray flux bombardment. Looking to the future, SC 26 remains to be seen yet is predicted with of even lower sunspot activity than SC 25, up to a possible complete shutdown (no sunspot activity for a prolonged, unknown period of time). We will enter this uncharted territory by 2030. This is what mankind needs to prepare for).

\#4/ Here is a great [snapshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Sunspot_Numbers.png) of our current status to the right showing in detail the 11yr MC within the longer GSM cycles dating back 400 years. Notice the [Maunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum) GSM far left and the length of time it tracked. This period is known as the [little ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age).

\#5/ Here is a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum#/media/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png) of the Holocene period we are currently experiencing. This period in which we are residing is very rare when seen through the eyes of modern man. The graphs and information on [this page](http://www.dandebat.dk/eng-klima7.htm) will arouse serious contemplation for the reader. Notice graphs 3-4-5 down the page. I will touch more on this later.

GSM's are cycles of the sun at minimum sunspot activity for longer periods of time that produce extreme weather conditions on earth that ultimately lead to global cooling up to the point of glaciation. In other words, this is how, when, where and why an ice age occurs. The signs to look for during a GSM cycle is extreme weather changes.

Examples of extreme weather are prolonged freezing temperatures, earthquakes, volcanism, heavy rains, sever flooding, hurricanes, tornado's, jet stream realignment, etc. These natural occurrences lead to crop loss and food shortages. Add to this wild animal extinction level die-off, disease and reduction in population.

It is recorded that when these GSMs occur, civilizations fall. Many Chinese dynasties have fallen during a GSM cycle due to the lack of food. The people's growing discontent of current rulership forces change. This fact is actually written in the Chinese record dating back over 4000 years.

When the sun is in minimum there are fewer sunspots. Fewer sunspots affect the planet in ways that cause earth to reduce it's [already diminished](https://www.tttruth.com/the-truth-about-earths-degrading-protection-layer/) protective magnetosphere layer which ultimately allows more [cosmic ray flux](https://www.space.com/32644-cosmic-rays.html) into the planet.

This cosmic high energy radiation is mysteriously formed outside the solar system. One resulting effect cosmic radiation flux has is, it heats up the earth's core liquefying the mantle which causes earthquakes and volcanism. The loosening of the mantle allows the earth's tectonic plates to move more easily. The increased volcanism spews ash into the atmosphere creating a blanket that reflects the suns radiation back into space therefore producing a cooling effect on a global scale. An ice age of sorts sets in.

The ancients knew the cause and effect of this natural cycle. It is believed they were actually trying to warn future civilizations of this very event that historically occurred over and over again. As stated before their warnings are in their writings on walls, tablets, paintings, pottery, etc. The Mayan calendar is the perfect example of a GSM timetable.

We are in the 21st century and the common person has no idea of these cyclical events. These natural cycles were common knowledge amongst our ancient ancestors.

In gradeschool, highschool, even at college level this information is not taught and I believe it is purposefully hidden from the general population. Even modern day scientists don't talk about this. I should say ""funded"" modern day scientists.

Man-made global warming, we constantly hear about it all over the macro news outlets how man is causing the earth to heat up due to increased Co2 levels and if we don't stop our way of life we will all fry.

This could not be further from the truth. Science does not back this up. Independent scientists have proven without a doubt that [temperature does not follow Co2 increases](https://cornwallalliance.org/2017/06/global-temperature-and-co2-which-drives-which/). The current models are seriously flawed.

What science does back up is the fact that the earth temperature runs in cycles, always has, always will. It is recorded that we are currently in a very easy, steady¬† temperature period called the [holocene](https://www.livescience.com/28219-holocene-epoch.html) of the last 11,400 years. Before this period dating back to the previous warm period between 115k and 130k years ago, the earth had seen wild temperature fluctuations.

This current holocene period is the only reason why we are here today as we are. Dating back 7k years the Nile dwellers started to farm and domesticate animals, only because of constant warm weather. There were no anthropogenic causes for this warm period.

All current data, looking at sunspots, knowing the cyclical output of the sun, recognizing all the severe weather, it is determined we are descending into what is called the Modern Grand Solar Minimum. There will be no global warming, there will be cooling. I emphatically state that in 2012 we started our decent with the aforementioned weather effects gaining traction and moving rapidly to where we are today.

In a book written in 1977 by Ervin Laszlo et al. entitled [Goals for Mankind](https://www.amazon.com/Goals-Mankind-Report-Club-Rome/dp/0525034552), A Report to the Club of Rome on the New Horizons of Global Community- in chapter 13 labeled Global Food Goals, these scientists discuss the impending ice-age and the resulting food shortages.

They knew about this in 1977.

Recently, starting with the year 2017 we saw unprecedented sever weather on all fronts. [Hurricane after hurricane](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/09/23/harvey-irma-maria-why-is-this-hurricane-season-so-bad/?utm_term=.7de00841334c)producing billions of dollars worth of damage and human loss. Sever flooding globally.

An [uptick in earthquakes](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/#%7B%22autoUpdate%22%3A%5B%22autoUpdate%22%5D%2C%22basemap%22%3A%22grayscale%22%2C%22feed%22%3A%227day_m45%22%2C%22listFormat%22%3A%22default%22%2C%22mapposition%22%3A%5B%5B-86.35757936849899%2C-315%5D%2C%5B86.35) measuring 4.0 or greater with massive amounts of lives lost, again globally. [Volcanism uptick](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/) on a global scale producing massive ash clouds blanketing the atmosphere. This will lead to [massive animal die-offs](http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/animal-deaths-birds-fish-end-times.html) and crop reduction.

As we slide further and further into the Modern GSM things will get increasingly worse and there are nearly 8 billion people on this planet that all need to eat.

We have established the fact that the sun changes constantly and that it runs in cycles of increased and diminished output. We have also established that these ""down"" cycles have an ill effect upon our globe and consequently it's inhabitants. We have determined that without doubt, with all of our understanding, the sun is shutting down. The signs are there. The science is there.

If the earth changes are due to the sun cycles and resulting increase of cosmic ray flux, I think it only prudent to ask, is something affecting the sun also?

I leave this discussion for another time.

For now, mankind must learn modern survival techniques. One must delve into study regarding self preservation in this modern age. We must learn how to prepare and fend for ones self and family lest you be waiting in a long line for your daily handout of food from the government that will undoubtedly not be nutritious. Everything we take for granted in our modern world will become a luxury. Running water, nutritious food, automobiles, electricity, work, toilet paper, soap, peace of mind and the list goes on.

With all this hard data and some speculation, I conclude something within our society is amiss and that history was purposefully hidden from us. We are on our own. Do not wait for your government to sound the alarm. It will either never come or it will be too late, by design.¬†

To delve further into this topic I will leave you with a few websites that will provide the truth in your discovery.

[The Watchers](https://watchers.news/) this is the only global weather channel you'll ever need for truth.

[Principia Scientific International](https://principia-scientific.org/) is the one stop source for unlimited, uncorrupted scientific weather data. They also discuss the problems with consensus science. ¬†

Here are links to some people who I feel are a good source of information to help you understand and prepare for the coming GSM.

[Oppenheimer Ranch Project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6VhLE7qAeW8NZm6PsXGGrQ) / Diamond, a paleo-climatologist by trade is building a self sustaining habitat in Colorado. He reports on the GSM with hard data and history to provide easy understanding. This is done on a daily basis. Diamond is a crackup with a great sense of humor albeit a bit on the edgy side. Works for me.

[Adapt 2030](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-5dIHmtQzHIdNCs7-bEdCA) / David Dubyne is putting all this into layman's terms and has many video files for reference on the GSM and how it affects crop output. David also has a keen outlook on crypto currencies and how they may play a leading monetary role during this GSM cycle. He documents on youtube multiple times per week with short to the point videos.

[Ice Age Farmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-Am0t4qQaP_Do9FwMWw3Q) / Christian maps a path forward, building resilient, self-sufficient communities, and sharing knowledge in the Grand Solar Minimum, specializing in farming. He reports on a weekly basis.

376,A Minneapolis police trial looking like a cover-up in slow motion,0,"A Minneapolis police trial looking like a cover-up in slow motionWe're about to have a criminal trial for a police officer who shot and killed a woman who actually called the police to report what she thought might be a crime.  

Justine Ruszcyk (often referred to Justine Damond, I forget which was her maiden name) lived in a prosperous, white and liberal neighborhood in Minneapolis and called the police to report what she thought might have been a rape or an assault.  When the police were driving down her alley, she hit their car to get their attention and the officer in the passenger seat, Mohamed Noor, fired across his partner's chest and killed the unarmed Justine who was described as being in a t-shirt and yoga pants.

The entire incident has been full of apparently conspiratorial elements.  Neither of the two officers had their body cameras turned on, in violation of department policy.  Justine was unarmed, and the neighborhood (I've lived in Minneapolis my whole life, most of it within a couple of miles of the scene) has near zero crime.  Noor wouldn't speak to investigators (admittedly his right as a potential criminal defendant).

It was reported that Noor was hired as part of city ""Fast Track"" program, designed to get more unconventional background people into the police force.  There's been some controversy about what this program means.  One interpretation is that it's about weakening the requirements to get more minorities on the force, a competing one is that Fast Track candidates get the same police training, they just get some kind of academic credit for having something other than the standard community college ""criminal justice"" degree.

It's taken forever to get a trial for Noor, almost two years since the incident occurred.  The conventional explanation is that there were no witnesses except Noor and his partner.  Noor isn't talking and while his partner made a statement, I think it was limited due to his own culpability.  The County Attorney who previously had chosen *not* to use a grand jury in another officer involved shooting (a major shift in policy), changed gears and went back to the grand jury to compel testimony from people involved with the police force and Noor.

All along it's felt like everyone involved, despite being on the opposite sides of a lot of political and criminal justice issues, has something invested in this issue being brushed under the rug.  The cops don't want to be prosecuted for shooting people under any circumstances.  The County Attorney doesn't want to aggressively pursue police prosecutions because he works with and depends on cops to make cases.  The city political officials who backed the Fast Track program as a way to improve police/minority relations by improving its diversity don't want to be held responsible for potentially getting a woman killed when one of their program's star pupils apparently panicked, nor do they want the related idea that Somalis or minorities are less qualified.

The African American community doesn't want to deal with this -- while usually on the receiving end of police violence by white cops, they see hypocrisy in prosecuting a black cop for killing a white woman when white cops who kill blacks don't get prosecuted.  Even more divisive, though, is that there's not a lot of love lost between the ""native"" African American community and the large Somali community.

Even the trial is starting to feel weird and compromised.  The presiding judge has [moved the trial to a small courtroom, officially limiting how many members of the media and family members can attend](http://www.startribune.com/judge-restricts-media-public-s-access-to-noor-murder-trial/507810372/), has [refused the media's requests for electronic recording/filming](https://kstp.com/news/judge-rules-cameras-not-allowed-courtroom-trial-former-minneapolis-police-officer-mohamed-noor/5258211/), and is now [restricting what evidence can even be shown to the gallery \(and thus media\)](http://www.startribune.com/attorneys-judge-to-address-final-details-in-upcoming-noor-trial/507825992/).

The entire case seems to compromise nearly anyone who is related to it -- cops, prosecutors, blacks, politicians.  Minneapolis is also a one-party town, totally controlled by the Democratic party, including the county prosecutor.  The people with the most to lose here seem to be people related to the Democrats, since Fast Track was their policy and they run the city government.

Ironically, the police seem to be the ones with something to gain, even if their former officer is convicted.  They can argue Fast Track was a bad idea, cops should come from the programs/backgrounds they've always come from and that rushing minorities into the force is a bad idea.  Plus this lets them run a pesky immigrant minority out of the force (he has already been fired, though its not hard to see him suing to get his job back if he wins a not guilty verdict).

Yes, that certain company is Epic. I was like, when the hell did I created an account? I thought, maybe I bought a game, it needed an account, and it was created in the game. So I checked over what titles were owned by Epic... what was my surprise, haven't played any of them.

Then, I stumble on Fortnite. I thought, ok, it is the trending game, a lot of people is hyped, maybe someone used my mail just to get access to the game. How did they get my mail?, I don't know. Maybe the wrote whatever they thought about. Maybe a typo. Maybe it was just a coincidence. Then, I realized, what shitty design for creating an account, didn't ask to confirm mail or something. So I tried just to delete the account. Didn't find out how to do it, so I just set a complicated password so no one could have access to the account, changed whatever information I could so it didn't have anything useful in there, and I called it a day.

Recently, I heard about Epic stealing information. And my paranoid mind kicked in: what if Epic got a databes of mails of gamer people... what if they started to send those ""someone is trying to use your account"" mails just to make us to turn our heads on Epic.

Our tour guide on the bus tour made sure at the very beginning when we went passed a CoS recruitment center to never go into or entertain anyone trying to talk to you from there. Breath of fresh air for me because I had the typical pre-judgement that a lot of people here were into the CoS. Now fast forward on our tour, we're seeing these mansions and houses of Bob Barker, Laurence Fishburne, Will Ferrell, etc. We are driving and go past a few of the gated communities. A couple of them have their guards out front and the big walls or fencing around them, but one struck me as odd and the guide even pointed it out. One of the communities had the barbed wire fences pointed towards them. They also had that bar that lifts up to let you in if you're allowed in on the exit side. It wasn't on the enter. It seems you can enter as you please, but to have on an exit side where it seems you need to correct permission to leave kind of left me with a weird feeling.

397,Trump Could Be Legitimately Impeached for Colluding With Jews and Israel,0,"Trump Could Be Legitimately Impeached for Colluding With Jews and IsraelTheoretically, Democrats could impeach Trump for colluding with Jews and Israel. They won‚Äôt do that because all the top Democrats in political power are guilty of doing the same thing.

None of us are surprised that Donald Trump adopted a pro-Israel foreign policy. While not emphasized during his 2016 presidential campaign, it was certainly a part of his platform. We have a political situation in the United States where it is currently impossible for anybody to win the presidency without having a pro-Israel foreign policy stance. It is especially true with the Republicans.

The Jew-run media plays a role yes, but it is also because the Republican Party has a base of idiotic Christian Zionists who falsely believe that Jews are the chosen people of God. Many of them believe in this weird end times bullshit, thinking that they‚Äôll be raptured into heaven prior to a biblical apocalypse. Naturally, all of this is centered around events in Israel. These deranged people saw the establishment of Israel in 1948 as a sign that Jesus was about to return and that the end times as told in the Book of Revelation was right around the corner.

Many of us were willing to begrudgingly accept a continued pro-Israel foreign policy so long as the ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù agenda was implemented. That‚Äôs because the domestic affairs of the United States are an immediate priority, the most important issue being immigration and the changing racial demographics of the country. What‚Äôs happening on the other side of the world with Zionist Jews slaughtering Palestinians is not a top-shelf priority.

Unfortunately, what we‚Äôve gotten is very little of the MAGA agenda while Israel has gotten all if not more than they could have ever asked for. Here‚Äôs a list I compiled from a previous article along with a few additions.

Recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel.
Recognized Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital and moved the American embassy there.
Provided billions of dollars in foreign aid to Israel.
Cut foreign aid to the Palestinians.
Completely cut all formal relations with Palestine.
Attacked Syria twice over fake gas attack footage.
Criticized Ilhan Omar as an anti-Semite for saying that the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC exists.
Spent a good part of his recent State of the Union speech reminding people of the Jewish Holocaust hoax.
Established a major arms deal to Saudi Arabia to help counter Iran, Israel‚Äôs main regional enemy.
Implemented sanctions on Iran and pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal.
Consistently defended Israel at the United Nations.

RT also did a segment on the recently held AIPAC conference making similar observations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GUyADPUJnQ

The fact that Trump has done more for Israel than the Americans who voted him into office is reason enough for Congress to justify filing articles of impeachment.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that Trump is surrounded by Jews and a variety of people who have pledged their allegiance to Israel. His Jew son-in-law Jared Kushner is the most obvious example, but it isn‚Äôt just him. All we have to do is take a look at the recent AIPAC conference.

Vice President Mike Pence delivered a deranged speech bragging about how much they‚Äôve done for Israel. He comically claimed that doing all of these things for Israel was somehow in the best interest of the United States even though it obviously is not.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u2WKAI4luw

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also delivered a speech where he talked about how it was such a great honor for him to have visited Israel. He described anti-Zionism as being anti-Semitism while making a number of other very bizarre statements.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jspOyaxkXYk

Under normal circumstances, it would be quite concerning to see the top political leadership of the United States focusing their energy on advancing the interests of a foreign country. In fact, it would be grounds for immediate impeachment. Many Democrats admit that this is absolutely a basis for impeachment. All you have to do is look at how seriously they took the conspiracy theory that Trump secretly colluded with Russia in order to win the 2016 presidential election. The whole thing might have been a big hoax, but it showed that they believe it is a big problem if a foreign country tries to interfere in our political system.

Despite all that, there is no talk from Democrats about Trump colluding with Israel or demanding his impeachment over this. And that‚Äôs because the top leadership of the Democrat Party is also colluding with Jews and Israel.

The Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke at AIPAC and professed how much she and the Democrat Party is doing for Israel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkLOmdiJpGU

A few months back, Pelosi even said that the United States would continue providing foreign aid to Israel even if Washington, DC crumbled to the ground.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LmnQRnw8I

The Jew Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer addressed AIPAC again, pledging his support for Israel over the interests of America. He has regularly addressed AIPAC during his time in political office.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYx338MK1ts

House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer also delivered an AIPAC speech. Like Schumer, he has made previous speeches at AIPAC. Hoyer basically tells the Jews in attendance that he is a very good goy and that he loves Israel.

So even though Trump could theoretically be impeached for colluding with Israel, he won‚Äôt be because the top Democrat leaders in Congress are guilty of doing the same thing. They‚Äôre all pushing an ‚ÄúIsrael First‚Äù agenda.

It‚Äôs no wonder why Ilhan Omar took so much heat for simply mentioning that AIPAC exists. She exposed how both political parties are controlled by Jews and how they put the interests of Israel above the interests of America.",1,trump could Be legitim impeach for collud with jew and israel,trump could Be legitim impeach for collud with jew and israeltheoret democrat could impeach trump for collud with jew and israel they won t do that becaus all the top democrat in polit power

We provide Afghanistan and Iraq far more foreign aid every year than we do in Israel. This doesn't factor in the trillions we've spent securing these two nations. Why are we there? It isn't Zionism. 

We spent billions elsewhere throughout the Middle East (Jordan, Syria, etc), North Africa (Egypt), and Pakistan/Indian subcontinent. We spend far more money per year bankrolling sub-Saharan Africa and their questionable leaders. For what purpose? It isn't Zionism. 

We spent/spend hundreds of billions in Latin America over the years. Even today we hear about Trump cutting off three Central American nations from hundreds of millions of dollars we pay for virtually nothing. Billions of more dollars were pledged to this region. Nobody batted an eye or talked about anyone controlling us for giving them what amounts to blackmail money. 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-mexico/us-pledges-billions-in-aid-to-develop-central-america-curb-migration-idUSKBN1OH23X


Trillions of dollars throughout the Cold War defending Europe, fighting Communism, expanding our power, fighting the Russians and Chinese.....very little of it having to do with Zionism. 


That all being said, where do you people come off claiming Israel controls us? The United States spends money across the world securing ITS interests. Zionism is hardly our driving motivation but it is easier selling a progressive first-world nation to the public than the rest of that region. Israel is a strong partner, along with Saudi Arabia, in arguably the most important region. Oil is the motivation. It was our motivation for our entire Middle East policy, including our former alliance with Iran pre-Revolution. That period of time is completely forgotten here. The Shah of Iran was one of our closest allies and treated as well as you claim Israel is. We helped Iran become one of the most advanced military powers in the 70s with our shared technology. They were allowed to purchase the F-14 and offered the F-15, our most advanced jets, in the 70s. Iran would still likely be a major ally had they not went fundamentalist Islamist.

'A Florida man raised $100,000 to hound the families of victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. This how Alex Jones and Infowars helped him.'
The problem with Alex Jones is that he is not a truther but a monetizer. As soon as the heat was turned up on him and his opinion show he dropped Sandy Hook where others continued including the Helbig character. I looked at the Sandy Hook media project from a number of different angles. I was desperately trying to find proof that this was a real event. But unfortunately the evidence just in the news reporting never added up to that. People may have had their children killed and that would be a tragedy. It is just that there is no proof of that. The media, and social platforms have all tried to scrub all of the investigative journalists and research out of the hands of a curious public. Especially for the newer made for TV false flag attacks. You can tell it is a false flag. On a number of fronts. 1) it has a lone gun man who is a white guy, 2)he is 'crazy'-off-his-meds. 3)'HE"" is a pathetic person who could not drive a nail into a board but is in control of an arsenal of weapons and wearable tactical military garments 4)The mention of a long gun is always in there 5) if you dig you find that each event was going on at the same time as a drill that mimicked the event, putting all the people, victims, and rescue people involved in the event all on the same page and in the environment in which the event takes place. Hired actors, paid police and rescue, never seen before news anchors. And on many occasions the same people are used for the different events. 
This was not discovered by ass necks like Alex Jones. His job was to make it unpopular to uncover such things, to make it illegal, to be punishable to be curious about these events.

Alexandria cortez claims that most of her money comes from small donations. What we need to do though his look at the people behind her.

Most of her campaign funds came from the Super PAC known as Justice Democrats.

if you look at the FEC records you can see that most of Justice Democrats funding comes from hundreds of small donations from the same as a Super PAC ""actblue""

http://magaimg.net/img/7mpv.png


that means that while she can complain claim that they are all small donations they really aren't

Now let's see where actblue gets their money

http://magaimg.net/img/7mpu.png


as you can see from the first page alone actblue gets its money from OTHER super Pacs. As well as congressional committees

I didn't have time to go much farther than that. But from the way it looks is that the Democrats are using multiple different super Pacs as money funnels the funnel into each other and then follow it to different Congressional packs. Meaning there's probably hundreds of different super Pacs funneling monali around until they landed actblue which then gets funneled to Justice Democrats who run her camp

and by the way. Do you know who started Justice Democrats? That's right. The one and only cenk

Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children
https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/

""Excessive ingestion of fluoride may cause toxic and harmful effects. It is important to note that the major source of fluoride toxicity remains oral hygiene products. According to fluoride poisoning data collected by the American Association of Poison Control (AAPC), tooth paste ingestion remains the main source of toxicity followed by fluoride containing mouth washes and supplements (Table 1). The highest proportion (more than 80%) of the cases of fluoride toxicity was reported in children below the age of 6 (29).""

**edit:** adding for visibility since it was a great comment

&gt;List of some of the fluoridation accidents and ""overfeeds"" causing fluoride spikes in drinking water going back to the 1970s. Keep in mind this is only when somebody noticed and they knew the culprit was fluoride: https://fluoridealert.org/content/recent-fluoridation-related-accidents/

&gt;2019 ‚Äì Sandy, Utah: A snowstorm led to a fluoridation overfeed that resulted in high fluoride concentrations dissolving piping leading to elevated levels of manganese, aluminum, iron, arsenic, copper, &amp; lead. Babies &amp; pregnant women among those sickened as reported in news which estimates 3k homes and several schools affected. Slow city response.

&gt;2018 ‚Äì Hanover County, North Carolina: NEW HANOVER COUNTY ‚ÄîFluoride was detected at double the federal limit early this morning in the public water supply in New Hanover County, but the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority has no answers for how it happened. In at least one location north of Wilmington, Cape Fear Public Utility Authority tested a sample at 8 milligrams per liter before 5 a.m. this morning, according to North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality‚Äôs Regional Engineering Supervisor Hedi Cox. The federal maximum amount of fluoride allowed in public water systems is 4.0 milligrams per liter. The recommended guideline for the Environmental Protection Agency is 2.0 milligrams per liter [but the new goal is supposed to be 0.7mg/l]. Despite issuing a ‚Äúdo not drink‚Äù advisory to nearly 30,000 customers due to an ‚Äúabundance of fluoride‚Äù in the water, CFPUA has been unable to offer an answer to the question on everyone‚Äôs mind: How long have the levels been elevated?

&gt;2018 ‚Äì Franklin, Pennsylvania: Franklin General Authority members unanimously voted Tuesday to terminate fluoride services within the city‚Äôs water system. The vote followed an incident in February when elevated levels of the acidic chemical were discovered in some residents‚Äô water in the Third Ward, Oak Hill and Rocky Grove areas. Residents went without drinkable water for several weeks after city crews found an equipment malfunction at Barrett Flats had allowed a surplus amount of fluoride into the system‚Ä¶

&gt;2012 ‚Äì Kalamazoo, Michigan: An overfeed of fluoridation chemicals to the drinking water occurred and residents were not notified for 6 months. Representatives of the water facility say a fluoridation overfeed also occurred in 2006.

&gt;2011 ‚Äì Mount Airy, North Carolina: A valve malfunction caused an overfeed of fluoridation chemicals into the drinking water for residents and three schools.

&gt;2010 ‚Äì Asheboro, North Carolina: Mechanical error at water treatment plant caused overfeed of fluoridation chemicals into the drinking water system of over 220 households. 60 gallons of the chemical was released at once, rather than over a 24-hour period as expected.

&gt;2009 ‚Äì Brisbane, Australia: Equipment malfunction at water treatment plant caused massive overfeed of fluoridation chemicals, increasing the levels to 30ppm. 4000 households were impacted as the chemical seeped into the water supply for at least 4 hours.

&gt;2008 ‚Äì Germania Springs, Alabama: A fluoride tank at the pumping station emptied its entire contents into the drinking water supply increasing fluoride levels to a reported 20 mg/L. Several residents reported feeling ill.

&gt;2005 ‚Äì York County, Pennsylvania: 600 gallons of fluoridation chemicals overfed into the public‚Äôs drinking water, increasing levels to at least 24ppm for several large municipalities in York and Cumberland Counties.

&gt;2003 ‚Äì Marlboro, Massachusetts: A mechanical malfunction caused an accidental overfeed of fluoride went undetected for at least two hours into the drinking water, causing a fluoride level of 24 ppm, a significant change to the PH making it more acidic, and causing state environmental officials to warn residents to not use drinking water without flushing their system first.

&gt;2000 ‚Äì Norfolk and Wakefield, Massachusetts: Error with fluoridation equipment leads to fluoride levels as high as 23 ppm. Local health officials claim no one is affected, however news reports interview at least one resident with diarrhea and dizziness.

&gt;AUGUST 1993 ‚Äì Poplarville, Mississippi: Fluoride levels at local restaurant reach 48 ppm, perhaps as high as 200 ppm, after accident with town fluoridation equipment. At least 34 of the restaurant‚Äôs patrons are poisoned. A study in Public Health Reports finds that ‚ÄúThe most common symptoms were nausea (97%), vomiting (68%), diarrhea (65%), and abdominal cramps (53%); 14 people (41%) reported headaches, four (12%) reported burning sensations in the throat or chest, and one person reported excessive salivation. None recalled an abnormal taste to the water.‚Äù (SOURCE: Penman 1997)

&gt;MAY 1992 ‚Äî Hooper Bay, Alaska: One man dies, one man is airlifted to hospital in critical condition and 260 are poisoned. It is the largest reported fluoridation accident to date. Symptoms include ‚Äúnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, weakness, itching, numbness or tingling of an extremity, shortness of breath (and) fatigue.‚Äù (SOURCE: News Tribune 1992 | Gessner 1994)

&gt;FEBRUARY 1992 ‚Äî Rice Lake, Wisconsin: Residents vomiting. Centers for Disease Control state that 150 water consumers potentially at risk. A pump feed thought to have lasted for two days leads to fluoride levels as high as 20 ppm. The Wisconsin State Dental Director states, ‚ÄúTo be harmful, exposure would have to have been about 225 ppm.‚Äù This statement is incorrect, as serious adverse symptoms have been reported as low as 50 ppm, and death has occurred at 150 ppm. (SOURCE: Carton 1994)

&gt;JULY 1991 ‚Äî Portage, Michigan: Approximately 40 children develop abdominal pains, sickness, vomiting and diarrhea at an arts and crafts show at school. One of the city‚Äôs fluoride injector pumps failed. Fluoride levels not determined at the time, but later test at 92 ppm. (SOURCE: Carton 1994 | See study discussing this accident)

&gt;OCTOBER 1990 ‚Äî Westby, Wisconsin: Fluoride levels reach as high as 150 ppm after fluoridation malfunction. Four families suffer a week of diarrhea, upset stomach and burning throats. The water utility supervisor estimates the fluoride level to be ten times normal since it had burned his mouth. The elevated fluoride levels corrode the copper off the pipes in area homes, producing copper concentrations 70 times higher than the EPA recommended limit. (SOURCE: Carton 1994)

&gt;MARCH 1986 ‚Äì New Haven, Connecticut ‚Äì Of the 312 persons interviewed four days after the accident, in the 127 households at risk, 18% report symptoms of abdominal cramping, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis (profuse sweating), and fever. Others experience rashes and irritation from bathing and washing dishes. The fluoride levels peak at 51 ppm.

417,The nods of the_donald are secretly agents trying to supress their own supporters,0,"The nods of the_donald are secretly agents trying to supress their own supportersnow I know a lot of people won't even talk about this because of the hatred they have for that so others won't want to believe it because of the love they have for that sub but it should still be talked about because it's a legitimate conspiracy theory that ties into the conspiracy that moderator is on the site as a whole are controlled by special interest groups

Now this particular one I have actual possible evidence that they might be controlled opposition

Not direct evidence but the behavior seems pretty suspicious


Kristoff let's talk about how there was that major mod shake up when one of them moderators went off the rails and the admins basically handpicked a new set of moderators

After that point a lot of the subreddits rules changed.

Types of host that were basically a part of their culture we're band. Meniere's no more ""number of people who"" posts

They also made a rule that you cannot link directly to anybody's Twitter account except Donald Trump. That seems like a pretty suspicious rule. Before that a lot of pro Trump talking points were shared by linking directly to right-wing pundit Twitter accounts. 


But most recently are other little suspicious things. Like how they have certain words blacklisted to be entire posts or comments removed by the automoderator for certain keywords

and that's normal for every subreddit. But what those keywords are it's pretty suspicious

I mean whether you like her or not Alexandria Cortez is a goldmine for the Republicans. They turned her into a caricature and use her to rile up their base. That's undeniable

and yet her entire name is literally blacklisted from the subreddit. Any post with ""Alexandria Cortez"" or ""AOC"" is immediately removed. Why would they do that? Why would post about one of their most hated politicians not be allowed?


Other banned words include

Sessions (for awhile)

Facebook (for awhile)

AOC

Alexandria Cortez

Andrew yang

Ann Coulter

and I'm sure there's plenty of others that I just haven't even caught yet


they also have blacklisted several right-wing sites that are in some ways pro-trump.

well they had an entire stretch of time that almost all the left-wing websites including NBC MSNBC CNN the New York Times And The Washington Post were de-blacklisted (they had been blacklisted since the campaign)

so there's no direct evidence. The way that the moderators seem to have blacklisted everything that made that sub fun for its users and the way that they carefully curate the front page by using stickies and the way they have blacklisted many words that might be used by Trump supporters makes the entire thing very suspicious

why are they scared to talk about Alexandria Cortez? Why they scared of post mentioning Andrew yang? Neither one of them is even a slight threat to Trump in the 2020 elections. Since one is too young to run and the other has no chance of beating him

What is a blacklist the entire purpose of the sub?

These are questions that there aren't answers to. And I welcomed anybody is input on it. My theory is that a lot of those mods have been bought out. But very special interest groups. I assume some would be right wing special interest groups like The Heritage Foundation or Fox News but others may very well be left wing special interest groups seeking to silence the largest right-wing separated on the internet



L again. You don't have to be right wing or even support that subreddit to be interested in the conspiracy theory. It's a legitimate nonpartisan conspiracy theory can be discussed without involving politics

and it ties into other subreddits on the site are controlled by special interest groups. Such as the movies subreddit possibly being infiltrated by Hollywood companies

A redditor was browsing r/conspiracy when he found a thread that offended him. Instead of attributing the opinion to one redditor, he decides that surely this must reflect how everyone in r/conspiracy feels (despite the zero upvotes and the ostracizing comments). He makes a post titled:

r/conspiracy **drops any semblance of being a conspiracy sub by sharing a video of Owen Benjamin going on an anti-semetic tirade...**

This would be like if one American published a racist book, and another country reported the news as ""America drops any semblance of tolerance by....""

Over 2,000 people agreed with OP that this offensive post proves that r/conspiracy is not a conspiracy sub, but a hate sub.

The irony is if OP had never shared that offensive thread, it wouldn't have gotten any attention whatsoever. Instead, he thought he'd be a hero by sharing how awful some people's opinions are and blaming an entire subreddit for it. If he would've left it alone, maybe twenty people would've seen the offensive thread. Because he shared it- well over 2,000 people saw the offensive thread.

430,"While some people have been worried about fluoride or talking about Flint Michigan, cities across the United States have been covering up high levels of lead, dumbing down the public, and the vast majority of potential tap water contaminants are not being tested for.",0,"While some people have been worried about fluoride or talking about Flint Michigan, cities across the United States have been covering up high levels of lead, dumbing down the public, and the vast majority of potential tap water contaminants are not being tested for.The topic of fluoride is making the rounds. We have an issue that is far greater than any potential problems from fluoride. I feel that the topic of fluoride gets far too much attention in comparison to the greater issue of lead and thousands of other contaminants. 

In conversations about fluoride, it is frequently asked:

""Why would the US government want to hinder their own populations intellectual development?""

We already know lead leaches into the water supply due to the significant amount of money it would take to replace all of the lead lines spanning the country's water infrastructure. Lead is a really big problem because officials have been covering up the contamination across the country. Think Flint, but across countless water systems. They are dumbing down a generation on purpose. Think about that.   

To make matters worse, while we have a massive lead water conspiracy, there is also the problem of corporations illegally dumping waste into rivers, and some of these substances are very difficult to detect. The vast majority are not tested for. 

**Lead contamination**:

- ""US authorities distorting tests to downplay lead content of water."" https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/22/water-lead-content-tests-us-authorities-distorting-flint-crisis 

- ""NYC fudged records to show day care centers‚Äô water was tested for lead, but no tests were performed. DOHMH ‚Äî the agency that's required to inspect all 11,000 child care centers in New York City annually ‚Äî had more or less given up on the task."" http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-faked-day-care-centers-lead-water-level-test-records-article-1.2686760

- ""5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules."" http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/

- A USA Today investigation has identified ""almost 2,000 additional water systems spanning all 50 states where testing has shown excessive levels of lead contamination over the past four years, and at least 180 of the water systems failed to notify consumers about the high lead levels as federal rules require."" https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/

Why is lead in the water? One reason is because of The Lead Lobby. A lot of the city pipes that carry your water (not just pipes in your house) contain high levels of lead. Many of these are still in use. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509614/

**Information about other contaminants besides lead**:

- ""As of 2010, it was estimated that 84,000 industrial chemicals were used in the United States, with about 700 introduced annually.  Nearly 20 percent are secret, according to the EPA, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision."" http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html

- An extremely tiny percentage of these chemicals are tested for and regulated in tap water. Since we don't know what many of these chemicals are, it's very difficult to test for their presence in tap water. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html 

We obtain our water from lakes or rivers, which go through an insufficient filtering process. If the water in the lake or river is polluted with a chemical that is difficult to remove, then your tap water will also be polluted. Since we only test for about 100 contaminants, we are taking a risk every time we drink from a tap. 

- ""Records analyzed by The New York Times indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves. Companies sometimes test what they are dumping only once a quarter, so the actual number of days when they broke the law is often far higher. And some companies illegally avoid reporting their emissions, say officials, so infractions go unrecorded."" http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/us/13water.html (article written in 2009)

Here's an example of what gets through the filters at water treatment plants: ""94 percent of the tap water in the US is contaminated with plastic fibers."" http://time.com/4928759/plastic-fiber-tap-water-study/

A good example of what happens under these conditions is Dupont's ""C8,"" which caused a variety of medical problems for surrounding populations. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html 

It was also expensive and time-consuming to figure out what Dupont replaced C8 with, and that chemical was also making its way into a nearby river. https://theintercept.com/2016/03/03/how-dupont-concealed-the-dangers-of-the-new-teflon-toxin/



**Radiation contamination in drinking water:**

&gt;Research into Arizona town's uranium-contaminated water supply sparks change

&gt;Town leaders want to know why the state agency issued the first public notice about the danger in August of 2015, despite having reports of chemical samples showing federally unsafe contamination levels more than a decade earlier.

&gt;""Folks have been using the water for so many years without being told,"" said Raymond Smith Jr., a community leader in Sanders. ""Everybody is wondering, why are we just now getting this information?""

http://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/research-into-arizona-towns-uranium-contaminated-water-supply-sparks-change/124812713

Kathleen Hartnett White, the former chair of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality:

&gt;The Senate committee honed in on a 2004 document that showed White openly supported a TCEQ policy of subtracting the margin of error from tests for radiation contamination in water. If a public water supply was found to have amounts of naturally occurring radium or uranium that exceeded federal limits, Texas regulators would subtract the margin of error and lower the results. Under White‚Äôs leadership, the agency presented testimony that said, ‚ÄúMaintaining this calculation procedure will eliminate approximately 35 violations.‚Äù

&gt;A violation of the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs maximum limit for radiation would require water systems to notify citizens and take action to clean up the contamination or provide an alternate source of drinking water. White and other leaders in Texas worried about the high costs that might be incurred by water systems for a violation.

**Chemical combinations**:

By now you are realizing that many different contaminants can be in your water, either in low or high amounts, without anyone informing you about it. 

Some chemical combinations can have multiplicative effects (""synergistic toxicity""), which means the toxicity of the combination is much more severe than we would have thought by 'adding' the effects together. We really don't know much about this. Here is one example:

&gt;They show that some oestrogens such as ethinyloestradiol (one of the active ingredients of contraceptive pills) and organochlorine pesticides such as trans-nonachlor, although very weakly active on their own, have the ability to bind simultaneously to a receptor located in the cell nucleus, and to activate it synergistically.

The Facts:Numerous politicians and members of the elite, David Rockefeller included, have spoken out about their support for a one world government or a New World Order.

Reflect On:Do we truly know what these terms mean and the gravity of them? Are we aware of what is taking place already in our world and how it is enslaving large percentages of the population? What can we do to move beyond this situation?

The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation . . .  The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties . . .  [and] control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government. It operates under cover of a self-created screen [and] seizes our executive officers, legislative bodies, schools, courts, newspapers and every agency created for the public protection.

449,Jazz Jennings is a FRUAD,0,"Jazz Jennings is a FRUAD**EDIT: FRAUD**

In an interview of Jazz Jennings on the Meredith show she says that she **‚Äú‚Äúrealized she was transgender‚Äù‚Äù** at **two years old**:  ***‚Äú[At two]*** *I said that I was a girl...I knew who I was on the inside and made sure I defined it. And I asked* ‚Äò***when is the good fairy gonna take me along and change my body parts‚Äô*** *...that was a* ***turning moment*** *when they [my parents] realized I was different and had to help me become the girl I knew I was inside.‚Äù* 

At **3 years old** she was **diagnosed with gender dysphoria**. 

&gt;*""When I was 2 years old, I went up to my mom and asked her, 'When is the good fairy going to come with her magic wand and change my penis into a vagina?'"" Jazz Jennings, 18, told ABC News' ""Nightline"" co-anchor Juju Chang.*

On her show, ‚ÄúI am Jazz‚Äù there is clear *sexualizing of a minor* whether directly (asking her thoughts on an orgasm as a trans girl) or indirectly. They love to dance around the fact that she ‚Äúhas a penis‚Äù and talk about her sexuality often. 

Just for starters.

Now that said, there‚Äôs more to consider about Jazz: look up the anatomical differences between males and females. Now take a close look at Jazz. ***She has all the markers of a biological female***: feminine skull‚Äîno prominent brow ridge, no sloping back forehead, rounded jawline, small chin, no Adam‚Äôs apple, soft features, feminine wrists, clearly feminine digit ratio (pointer longer than ring) even how she puts on weight and it looks like hips about as wide as shoulders. And in this [**photo**](http://celebliveupdate.com/jazz-jennings-surgery-transgender-teen-dating-boyfriend/), female proportion arms and shoulders (last picture: *man* on the left, ***woman on the right***)

[other interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4kbybo60Y)

&gt;Notice her **physician** says ‚ÄúJazz is ***100% girl***.‚Äù

[C Riga Shira](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=39s&amp;v=UcbBGvRe4l4) exposes hidden transgenderism in entertainment fashion and politics...if this is the case, then transgender fraud becomes more likely.

Many people‚Äîeven those who look at conspiracy theories‚Äîare quick to label it as ‚Äúparanoia‚Äù or even prejudice (assuming the intent is to slander rather than point out things which concern the public‚Äôs interest). But influential people in the spotlight, especially ones who are idolized by children, are very different than people in the general public (because of their influence) and should be held to a different standard.  I believe we have an *obligation* to question the people and the messages which are shifting our perspectives and re-shaping our society as a whole.

**TLDR; Jazz Jennings‚Äô story doesn‚Äôt add up.....her show ‚ÄúI am Jazz‚Äù has significant sexual discussion/focus (i.e. orgasm talk) despite her being a *minor* at the time......and she appears to have natural female anatomy (skeleton), indicating she may not be transgender. These things should at least be considered since she is praised as a role model for kids with gender dysphoria.**",1,jazz jen is a fruad,jazz jen is a fruad edit fraud In an interview of jazz jen on the meredith show she say that she realiz she wa transgend at two year old At two I said that I wa a girl I knew who I wa on the insid and made sure I defin it and I ask when is the good fairi gonna take me along and chang my bodi part that wa a turn moment when they my parent realiz I wa differ and had to help me becom the girl I knew I wa insid At year old she wa diagnos with gender dysphoria gt when I wa year old I went up to my mom and ask her when is the good fairi go to come with her magic wand and chang my peni into a vagina jazz jen told abc new nightlin co anchor juju chang On her show I am jazz there is clear sexual of a minor whether directli ask her thought on an orgasm as a tran girl or indirectli they love to danc around the fact that she ha a peni and talk about her sexual often just for starter now that said there s more to consid about jazz look up the anatom differ between male and femal now take a close look at jazz she ha all the marker of a biolog femal feminin skull no promin brow ridg no slope back forehead round jawlin small chin no adam s appl soft featur feminin wrist clearli feminin digit ratio pointer longer than ring even how she put on weight and it look like hip about as wide as shoulder and in thi photo http celebliveupd com jazz jen surgeri transgend teen date boyfriend femal proport arm and shoulder last pictur man on the left woman on the right other interview http m youtub com watch v VH kbybo Y gt notic her physician say jazz is girl C riga shira http m youtub com watch t s amp v ucbbgvr l expos hidden transgender in entertain fashion and polit if thi is the case then transgend fraud becom more like mani peopl even those who look at conspiraci theori are quick to label it as paranoia or even prejudic assum the intent is to slander rather than point out thing which concern the public s interest but influenti peopl in the spotlight especi one who are idol by children are veri differ than peopl in the gener public becaus of their influenc and should be held to a differ standard I believ we have an oblig to question the peopl and the messag which are shift our perspect and re shape our societi as a whole tldr jazz jen stori doesn t add up her show I am jazz ha signific sexual discuss focu i e orgasm talk despit her be a minor at the time and she appear to have natur femal anatomi skeleton indic she may not be transgend these thing should at least be consid sinc she is prais as a role model for kid with gender dysphoria

The article isn't the best probably, but it's one take on the story, that's for sure. The question is, are these merely the ravings of a delusional former child star, or do they have some actual basis in reality? She accused her father of abusing her, and telling ""them"" to put a microchip in her brain. Microchip or not, her parents have basically had custody/conservatorship of her and she has been in and out of mental institutions ever since, to this day. Her parents control all her money and life decisions even though she is 32 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

The sinister though I keep coming back to is: what if she actually was trying to make a valid point in crying for help about being abused physically and mentally by her father? What if he's too well-connected in the vastly powerful entertainment industry, and he just buried the truth and had her institutionalized and pumped full of drugs? I know people in this sub talk about the pizzagate stuff all the time. We know that the entertainment and business industries are hiding a dark secret of child abuse, trafficking, and potentially mind control, and Amanda Bynes was among the top of the top of child stars. We have documented proof that MKULTRA and its byproducts have been used on civilians, and these programs and all records of them ceased to ""exist"" when Congress tried to look into the matter decades ago. Look at the former Mickey Mouse club stars and how many of them have publicly broken down (far beyond the point of a normal stressful life breakdown). Is this their mental programming beginning to show signs of wear? Look at how many female stars now must pay homage to Marilyn Monroe (allegedly the first celebrity example of a mind-controlled subject) in order to achieve fame and success. Look at how the sexualization of children is becoming normalized in mass media. Look at the mind control imagery present in popular culture, including monarch butterflies, mirrors, black and white checkered floors, etc. It is all interconnected. For a while I thought I was maybe reaching too far or exaggerating, but the more I look into these things, the more it all seems to add up, in an extremely disturbing way. These things are intended to be easily missed, but to those who are aware and ""in the know"", it is something of a sick inside joke. Plausible deniability, coupled with cointel techniques to make anyone asking questions out to seem crazy, ensure that those responsible are never held accountable. It really is insidious and the everyday citizen has absolutely no idea. I hope I'm making all this up, but I know inside that I'm not. I also worry for my own safety a bit after publicly making statements like this.

If you're a shill or spook just looking to discredit independent rational conversation in order to advance a predetermined agenda, keep it to yourself. Any thoughts?

When the internet was created, it was believes that this was an amazing accomplishment of humanity.  It was a bastion of freedom of information and anonymity.  Only to find out 20 years later that it may be quite the opposite.  The internet is now a land of filter bubbles, censorship and the complete loss of all personal privacy.  It is now becoming even creeper with China Social Credit Score type pan-opticon type systems being rolled out.    We really missed the mark in our initial assumptions.

Now it is not far fetched to relate this to crypto.  Touted in much the same manner, it even had a .com crash at year 10 which is similar in timing and execution.  I am beginning to believe that this will be the global currency of the future and will likely be the exact opposite of everything originally thought.  The ruling class has an uncanny ability to corrupt everything and is not sitting idly by while us common folks create a currency that makes them obsolete.  This line of thinking is naive and ignorant of history, even such recent history as the internet itself. 

After many conversations with bitcoin people it is becoming obvious that something is amiss here.  The logic doesn't add up and the conversations have actually led me to this idea.

468,"Wikileaks Suppressed, Mossad ran 9/11 Arab ‚Äúhijacker‚Äù terrorist operation",0,"Wikileaks Suppressed, Mossad ran 9/11 Arab ‚Äúhijacker‚Äù terrorist operation 

https://i.redd.it/rqyyuerjf2p21.jpg

The Mossad infiltration team comprised six Israelis, comprising two cells of three agents, who all received special training at a Mossad base in the Negev Desert in their future control and handling of the ‚ÄúAl Qaeda‚Äù cells. One Mossad cell traveled to Amsterdam where they submitted to the operational control of the Mossad‚Äôs Europe Station, which operates from the El Al complex at Schiphol International Airport. The three-man Mossad unit then traveled to Hamburg where it made contact with Mohammed Atta, who believed they were sent by Osama Bin Laden. In fact, they were sent by Ephraim Halevy, the chief of Mossad.

The second three-man Mossad team flew to New York and then to southern Florida where they began to direct the ‚ÄúAl Qaeda‚Äù cells operating from Hollywood, Miami, Vero Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach. Israeli ‚Äúart students,‚Äù already under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for casing the offices and homes of federal law enforcement officers, had been living among and conducting surveillance of the activities, including flight school training, of the future Arab ‚Äúhijacker‚Äù cells, particularly in Hollywood and Vero Beach.

In August 2001, the first Mossad team flew with Atta and other Hamburg ‚ÄúAl Qaeda‚Äù members to Boston. Logan International Airport‚Äôs security was contracted to Huntleigh USA, a firm owned by an Israeli airport security firm closely connected to Mossad √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù International Consultants on Targeted Security √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú ICTS. ICTS‚Äôs owners were politically connected to the Likud Party, particularly the Netanyahu faction and then-Jerusalem mayor and future Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

It was Olmert who personally interceded with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have released from prison five Urban Moving Systems employees, identified by the CIA and FBI agents as Mossad agents. (VT and Madsen‚Äôs own sources now say that Giuliani and US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald had other teams released as well including those who, according to the 2003 suppressed DOE 9/11 report, placed explosives under the 3 towers and tried to destroy all transportation connectors to Manhattan as well.)

The Israelis were the only suspects arrested anywhere in the United States on 9/11 who were thought to have been involved in the 9/11 attacks. [Source](https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/03/10/blockbuster-wikileaks-suppressed-mossad-ran-911-arab-hijacker-terrorist-operation/)

Celebs like the Williams sisters being secretly men.  Along with Cameron Diaz.  Look at many  female Congress people too.  The belief is that in order to get into positions of power you have to transgender your children and yourselves.  There‚Äôs a video with lady Gaga getting off a motorcycle and a penis is visible.  With singers it‚Äôs because they can become ‚ÄúCastrato‚Äôs‚Äù which gives them great vocal range for their singing voices (Mariah Carey, Gaga , Madonna).  When a lot of the women get older you can start to see that they are old men because men‚Äôs skulls grow more then women‚Äôs.  Always look at the width of their shoulders being wider than hips, brow ridge, square jaw, sloping forehead,  40 % larger trachea compared to tea women, long arms, torso straight up and down on possible male-to-female transgenders.  Look up pictures of old First Ladies for example.  Michelle Obama is ( video showing her testicles hitting her loose pants on Ellen‚Äôs show when she‚Äôs dancing).

472,How to rule the world and get away with it,0,"How to rule the world and get away with it



Here are 3 rules for your corporate/cult/society/religion/institution entity that seeks world domination.

Rule 1. Give people what they want. 
Some boring philosopher once said "" The mob rules Rome. Emperors only appease they're appetite and direct it "". 

People want messiahs, gives them messiahs.
People want to see Alex Jones meltdown at some hippie, go for it.
Keeping people happy is what bread and circuses are all about.
You can secure a low level of political conditioning within the population if you give them what they want. Cheap.
Everyone loves a JFK like figure. Sure you can do that.
Sell they're likeness, merchandise the shit outta them while promoting they're serious political strides.
The everyday Joe saying "" I like this person. They tell me what i want to hear "".
Got them by the balls now.
You don't need to come up with ideas for distracting the population, they will do it for you.
You can fling they're own shit back at them and they'll buy it.

Rule 2. People are attracted to meaning and purpose. Provide it for them.

As cynical as the population likes to believe itself they're not. They're human brains are wired to find meaning even if its not there.
Ever seen one of them on drugs ? secrets of the universe unfolding from a bathroom tile they've been drooling at for half an hour.
You can give them that meaning and purpose. At the same time you can mould they're minds to your preferred philosophy.
Want people to spend more money and work for less. Tell them they're civilisation/country thrives as a race and the winners lives only have value.
Promote the lives of the elite humans who surround themselves in excess. 
This solidifies the philosophy that only the rich lead happy lives in the minds of the working classes.
You can condition the population with meaning. Patriotism is a prime example. So are sports.
If you use rule 1 in conjunction with this, the people will tell you what they want meaning and purpose from. Then you can exploit that.

Rule 3. People love stories and will take morals from them.

Whether its just the boredom of being an average human or they're tiny capacity for intelligence, they love stories.
Anything to pull them away from the deafening monotony of their insignificant lives.
A popular narrative in the consciousness of the population can be exploited.
More automatic rifles for children a bad thing ?. 
Not if Woody and Buzzlight year defend the house from a home invasion and learn a moral lesson about courage and friendship in the process.
Not if the media is saturated with glamorising violence under the guise of moral authority. 
Not if the populations unconscious blood lust is exploited through gladiatorial programming.
"" i don't think its wrong to teach my toddler to use flash bangs. Jesus gives me the right to defend my property. "" the average Joe will say.
People will latch on to a story and rile themselves up. Use humans basic emotion of compassion to fool them into accepting your narrative and morality.
A brave war hero is infact a trained killer but because he was morally justified by popular opinion, the population will pray for them and even idolize them.
Many of the population will have a completely non violent philosophy on life 
and yet still support violence overseas in the name of whatever shit your throwing back at them. ( See Rule 1 )
Stories shape the populations feeble minds. Use they're weaknesses for escapism and condition your morality/philosophy onto them.

I hope this has been helpful and informative for your corporate/cult/society/religion/institution entity that seeks world domination.
Here at Universal Admin we encourage your successful dominance of the earth and will work hard to provide you with the experience 
you need to achieve your goals.

476,[meta] My recent experience w/ 5G,0,"[meta] My recent experience w/ 5Git's potent.  and clearly (to me) damaging to psychical and mental health of any living creature.

i recently rented an apartment.  pretty cool.  smart one bedroom, but the common areas are epic. more to the point...

the entire building is flying with 5G.

i was going to post a photo of the modem + router set but...

- i kinda forgot 

- i kinda didn't want to specifically single out any particular Brand‚Ñ¢ of 5G.

from the moment my partner and i stepped into the building:

- dizziness;

- naucia

- irritable *(what's the noun form of [""irritable""-ness?](https://www.dictionary.com/noresult?term=ir¬∑ri¬∑ta¬∑ble¬∑ness)?)*

- a quick feeling of being *very distracted*

- a constant *hazy mental focus*

i thought it may have been from a couple of factors:

- recently spent of a lot of physical energy moving into a new place;

- probably a bit dehydrated -- ***""stay hydrated""***

- new surrounding / environment / always a bit disconcerting

**i decided to log into my router, and** ***TURN-OFF 5G service*****:**

- i suggest everyone does this... ***(i.e., turn-off your 5G service)***

- 99% of Americans (and probably the same for the world) do not need 5G.  here's why

 - improved range ***-- NOT FUCKING ""SPEED""***

 - if you live in apartment, and you have 5G, you're a fucking idiot.  you might as well buy a fucking Ferrari, and and park that fucking Ferrari in your fucking living room.  yea, a lot of good that does you, right?! :D  ok. well... it's that how fucking stupid it is to have a 5 fucking G router in your apartment.

 - - #1 you are always limited to your internet provider's speed -- which is going to be ***WAY fucking slower*** than **2G**.  

 - - #2  you don't need the range.  mate, 2G got you and your apartment covered by an order of magnitude.

 - - [meta] fuck you shills pro 5G shills -- that's all you are, **go suck a phat dick in your mouth** :O{=fatfuckingstinkydickinshillsmouth


i digress.

fair to say, within minutes of turning-off my 5G services *(my router had both 2G and 5G turned-on, which most routes with 5G do also have an activate 2G service)*, both my wife and i noticed a steady decrease in:

- dizziness;

- naucia

- irritable *(what's the noun form of [""irritable""-ness?](https://www.dictionary.com/noresult?term=ir¬∑ri¬∑ta¬∑ble¬∑ness)?)*

- a quick feeling of being *very distracted*

- a constant *hazy mental focus*

so then i thought... ok... well, it did take me a day to think about and then actually DO ...turning-ff my 5g services.  so it was like at least 48 hours of having been settled.  a couple of nights of ""restful"" sleep - kinda ;)  i definitely was able to hydrate.  ok... so maybe it wasn't the 5G.  maybe i was just feeling better.

so... tonight i come down to the business center (epic 30 foot ceilings).  within minutes of getting situated, all the symptoms (see above) start coming back. and i will also note that every time i step outside i feel fine.  all good.  back to normal.

so (for me), it's pretty much that noticeable.

**5G viscerally fucks with me.**

and again, i personally don't need 5G anyway.  and most people don't -- its like, why?!  do you live on a goddamn ranch? ok fine.. do your do mate, but... for the rest of us, a single, central 2G router is all you need to provide stable network service to a:

- studio;

- a one bedroom;

- up to a 5 bedroom (reasonably)

- a small to medium-sized, single floor house;

- a small, single floor building;

- a small, single floor retail space;

---

sidenote:  i think elon and peter thiel and some of silcon valley elite are fucking out there on some crazy trips.  on the one hand, i love the idea of free internet for the world (i.e., what i believe is elon's mission with the ... micro-5g satellites to provide 5G router service to the globe.    love the concept.  on the other hand 5G makes me viscerally naucious -- which is a bit concerning to me.

wondering if there isn't a more ""tesla"" solution to the mission:  to deliver free internet for the world.  *(if that is really the mission?)*

478,Aliens and the Moon,0,"Aliens and the MoonIt has been said that there are aliens look like us and flew into the sky, such as that certain artwork in regards, but that is quite strange as we are all living down here. Then there's the Moon which was placed there according to some historical documents.

Overall, this bugged me, a lot. What if they tried a lot to make a similar world to their own and it became Earth countless eons in the past? However, they failed to account the dinosaurs so they have to wipe them out with a strategic strike that could purge entire species out and replace them with their own thus making the world we know of to this day. That strike also created some left-over parts which became the 'realms' of the 'pantheons' who guided us.

Of course, in every scenario, we have to leave our loved ones soon. So... they left us, and because of the war and disasters that took place there but not before they place a lot of defenses to prevent other hostile life forms from finding us.

Since then, everyone lived and the Era of Atlantis began. That is until a disaster unforeseen happened. What disaster? Who knows... But there is one thing that disaster brought.

The Appearance of the Moon itself before the disaster even begun.

Perhaps that moon is a real satellite made by them but gained that rocky exterior from that disaster event. Perhaps it was placed there by the victor or survivors of that disaster event to observe us.

Who knows?

A Guide to Understanding. No muslims hijacked planes. No muslim involvement. Call out disinformation when you see it.Before TMOR come and calls me a jihadi muslim sympathizer, I think it's important for you to know that I used to hate Muslims/Islam over 911. I fully fully believed they did 9/11, even years after watching 'Fahrenheit 9/11' and the other documentary that I can't remember the name of.

So for years, I knew 911 was a lie.. But still blamed Muslims and our government. Our goverment knew these crazy religious idiots were gunna hijack planes and kill tons of people and our goverment let them do it. Fuck them and fuck anyone that looks like them. I was conditioned exactly as planned. Hate Muslims for 911 and let the war on terror happen.

That was until a few years ago when I started to question those very same documentaries.. I found it odd that extreme Muslims who are willing to kill themselves for thier religion would be doing coke and banging bookers before hand... That was my first clue.

It made me hate Muslims even more. Now they are crazy hypocrites.. And their holy book tells them to kill anyone thats not a believer. Being an athiest, I saw Islam as the top problem in the world. The thing that needs solving.




But then I watched a documentary called 'Boston Unbombing - How and Why Boston was a staged false flag hoax attack.' This changed everything. I recognized the purpose of the hoax...to justify invading more land. Got me thinking.. The goverment staged Boston event.. Lied about Muslims...hmmm


So i went back research 911. And there it was. The piece of evidence so strong that it survived a plane exploding inside of one of the towers, survived being burnt on the way down, survived the crumbling buildings falling onto themselves, and was discovered by FBI on 911 and turned over to our lovely press as strong evidence that Muslims hijacked the plane. This very strong piece of evidence I refer to as 'The Magic Muslim Passport'

This is the piece of evidence that proves that NO muslims were involved in hijacking any planes.




Here is the logic

'fake events have fake evidence. Real events have real evidence' - if muslims did hijack planed on it 911, there would be no need to present the country fake evidence. They could wait and supply us real evidence. But none exists bc no muslims hijacked planes. None. No planes were hijacked.

Is the recent rush of Joe Joe the Pedo memes a deep-state auto-bot attack to distract from Chirstchurch flase flag terrorist attack?  NZ police are now killing people who refuse to hand-over their guns.  (Irony!?)

I am probably alone in this, but Joe Joe is creepy.  I get it.

Do you know Joe Joe's son (Beau) died of ""brain cancer.

Beau was admitted to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (i.e., CIA Hospital) in Bethesda, Maryland.

When Beau died, Joe Joe launched a foundation in Beau's name -- promising ""to reorganise the state‚Äôs justice department to better combat identity theft, internet **[stalking by pedophiles](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/31/beau-biden-dies-of-brain-cancer)**, street crime and abuse of the elderly.""

He did this in part because Beau [""devoted himself raising awareness about child sexual abuse.""](https://thinkprogress.org/what-beau-biden-wanted-everyone-to-know-about-the-issue-that-defined-his-career-3b97c8afc194/)

...and [""Beau Biden Prosecuted Earl Bradley, One Of The Worst Child Abusers In History ‚Äî And Turned Down The Senate To Do So""](https://www.bustle.com/articles/87165-beau-biden-prosecuted-earl-bradley-one-of-the-worst-child-abusers-in-history-and-turned)

I remember when these Joe Joe the Pedo thing started, they were shopping around this ""proof"" video where joe Joe was whispering [""‚ÄúDo you know how horny I am to have a 13-year-old girl standing right next to me?‚Äú""](https://newspunch.com/joe-biden-young-girl-horny/)

***turns out***, he was saying [""do no now how ***honored*** I am to have...""](https://youtu.be/zWAu7LwkmRM?t=1954)

And frankly, **watch the rest of the video.**  And tell me that Joe Joe doesn't just about finger fuck every person that gets on stage with him -- he has got to be one of the most touchy feeling Mf's I have every seen!

i.e., He's not a Pedo.  He's just a creepy touchy feely guy.

Consider the the Joe Joe the Pedo‚Ñ¢ conspiracy is one of the Flat Earth's of politics.  

 - Beau knew too much.  

 - Biden needed to be kept in check.  Isn't that what they do? Right?  They (the deep-state) accuses you doing when ***they*** are actively doing (pedophilia and child trafficking).  This just reeks of a disinfo campaign.  

And consider the timing:

- Judicial Watch just dumps ~300 new very seriously incriminating emails;

- Julian Assange is Possibly Renditioned;

- Mueller Report just came out w/o any Trump incitements;

- Jussie + Harris + Booker

- NZ Multi-Shooter terrorist Attack

What better way to throw off the wolves than to throw them a bone?

I am probably alone when I insist that Joe Joe is an unwitting stool pigeon - meant to distract the wolves from the deep-state fiascos.

Joe Joe is lame.  He's like the 2020 Al Gore.

Higher healthcare costs are due to artificial scarcity.",0,"Affirmative action policies in medical school admissions manipulate the supply of medical workers, and this reinforces shortages created by monopolistic licensing. Higher healthcare costs are due to artificial scarcity.#Affirmative action policies in medical (medical field generally) school admissions reduces the supply of medical providers, and acts as a protectionist measure to further raise the barrier to entry and reduce competition among providers.  This reduces medical patient options in the care/treatment process, reinforces the power of licensing monopolies, reinforces a small elite of medical providers, decreases competition among medical professionals, decreases the motivation for quality among medical professionals, creates an artificial scarcity of medical professionals, and encourages higher healthcare costs.

------------------------

Note:  discussion on 'more doctors doesn't matter if there's not more beds' is sometimes brought up as an excuse for monopolistic practices effecting the size of the medical workforce and easy access to medical care.  First, there are other factors affecting the artificial scarcity in medicine such as crony 'certificates of need' which serve to limit distribution of medical facilities and equipment. Second, medical providers benefit from making healthcare artificially scarce by getting higher prices and more elitist status.


&gt;The study, being published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found that the incomes of primary care doctors and orthopedic surgeons were substantially higher in the United States than in other countries. Moreover, it said, the difference results mainly from higher fees, not from higher costs of the doctors‚Äô medical practice, a larger number or volume of services or higher medical school tuition.

&gt;The average U.S. general-medicine physician makes $218,173 a year ‚Äî nearly double the average of all 11 countries. American specialists make $316,000, while their counterparts take home $98,452 in Sweden and $202,291 in Australia. American nurses make considerably more than elsewhere, too.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;What's Not Driving Up Prices: Too Much Care
&gt;
&gt;Foremost among the conclusions of the new Harvard paper is that unnecessary care ‚Äî tests and procedures that do nothing to promote health ‚Äî is not the biggest driver of America‚Äôs high health spending.

#Monopolistic medical licensing/schooling and shortages in medical care


&gt;One of the most critical supply side issues in health care is the supply of qualified doctors.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The case of health care regulations is an interesting one, as state governments have empowered private medical boards with unilateral authority to set the rules for the medical profession, including the issuing and revoking of medical licenses. These boards effectively function like government regulatory agencies, with the important difference that they lack the opportunity for public comments, and thus are immune from any political pressure from citizens.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Retail clinics, pharmacies, and even supermarkets are capable of offering routine medical services to patients with a convenience and regularity impossible in traditional physicians‚Äô offices. Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) has aggressively lobbied against the availability of this type of facility.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;There are currently only 129 accredited medical schools in the United States, too few to turn out enough doctors to meet the demand.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;By reducing the regulatory burden on physicians, providing more competition among medical boards, and permitting more autonomy for alternative practitioners, patients could see both relief from the coming doctor shortage, as well as lower prices across the board for medical care.

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-19/how-government-helped-create-coming-doctor-shortage

&gt;To some extent, dentistry created its own problem. Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Health Association, said today's shortage of dentists can be traced to the closing of seven dental schools in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1980, he said, the United States produced 6,300 dentists. Ten years later, the number was down to 4,000.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Some groups representing doctors are resisting similar efforts to allow nurse practitioners to, for example, write prescriptions and admit patients to the hospital.

https://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2013/12/30/are_there_enough_doctors_for_the_newly_insured_786.html

&gt;The Association of American Medical Colleges has recently predicted a nationwide shortage of somewhere between 40,800 and 104,900 physicians by 2030.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ironically, one of the biggest obstacles to improving access to health care providers is the profession itself, enabled by a plethora of public and private agencies that control licensing and certification. These often inadvertently limit access to care rather than enhance it.

#Affirmative action supports monopolistic medicine


&gt;""In addressing the question of whether minority physicians are more likely to serve underserved populations, studies have relied on self-report survey data and the definition of an underserved population has varied.""
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;""Researchers examined the failure rates from a national sample of all first-time U.S. medical student examinees from 1986 through 1988 and found that approximately 50% of African-American examinees failed the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Part I competency-based licensure test, compared to a 12% failure rate for whites""
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;""Because medical schools are highly selective, the size of the observed racial group differences will in practice almost eliminate the selection of certain minorities when that selection is based on maximizing the academic achievement and/or intellectual aptitude measures.""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623946/

&gt;""And we should cap the number of Jews if non-Jews prefer not to have Jewish doctors, and the number of doctors of non-Western religions (Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, etc.) if they are less desired by the general population of patients.""

&gt;However, Princeton University's Russ Nieli argues that affirmative action only serves to reinforce negative stereotypes, particularly for black and Latino applicants. Instead, he argues for a completely merit-based system that accounts for specific qualifications that can help meet patient needs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Until that occurs, ""the huge credentials gap between black entrants to medical and professional schools and whites and Asians will remain‚Äîand along with it, the understandable suspicion of the competence of the black graduates,""

513,AIPAC Boycott Hoax: Democrats All Met with AIPAC Jew Masters Privately,0,"AIPAC Boycott Hoax: Democrats All Met with AIPAC Jew Masters PrivatelyThe entire American Jewish media was claiming that the ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù 2020 Democrat presidential candidates skipped the meeting of the Zionist Occupation Government overlords at AIPAC.

Meanwhile, the Israeli press is reporting that they all had secret meetings with this council of Jewish overlords.

Which is worse?

Giving a public speech to a foreign body of elite overlords, or meeting with those foreign overlords secretly while pretending to the goyim that you are not beholden to that cryptocracy?

In actual fact, the entire concept of AIPAC having this conference is outdated.

The reality of Jewish rule is that it only works when people are told they are not being ruled by Jews. So having all of these politicians go to a conference and publicly pledge allegiance to a foreign power really was not fit for this model of government-by-conspiracy.

It was possible in a pre-internet era to have these conferences and not have anyone see the video.

But now that we can see the video ‚Äì wow.
https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/after-boycott-claims-four-democratic-presidential-hopefuls-meet-aipac-delegates-1.7063905

Chuck Schumer declared that he was ‚ÄúThe Guardian of Israel‚Äù at an AIPAC conference.

At an AIPAC-adjacent Jewish Occupation Government conference, Nancy Pelosi declared that if the American Capitol crumbled, we would still send billions of dollars to Israel.

I think the Jews realized this is a problem when Ilhan Omar went out there and said ‚ÄúAIPAC!‚Äù and they had to call her an anti-Semite spreading anti-Semitic canards for simply mentioning that the organization exists.

People were like ‚Äúwell, if this is a hateful canard, then what the fuck are these videos of politicians swearing allegiance to Israel about???‚Äù

They were really pushing the limits of reality itself by trying to claim that it is an act of hatred to simply say that this organization exists and that American politicians go there and pledge to serve this foreign country. In fact, I have never seen anything like it.

Jewish rule is predicated on the fact that people do not know they are being ruled by Jews. There is nothing that actually even compares to this in history. Historically, there was always a king who you knew was in charge and if you knew that the buck stopped with him. If you had a grievance about something that was happening in the country, the responsibility of addressing it ultimately fell on the king.

‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù really is a Jewish invention. Because in this system, no one can ever be held responsible for anything. People have a need to point at some individual or group of individuals responsible for things that are happening, and in democracy, no one really knows where to point. Everyone that you try to point at can always point at someone else.

And then in the background of all of it, there are these Jews moving through the shadows and manipulating all events.

This is why ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù has become the highest moral value in a system run by Jews and it is why they attempt to spread it throughout the world using war.



Jews know that because the head of state in a democracy is merely a figurehead for a massive bureaucracy, and can be voted in and out whenever the people tire of them while the bureaucracy remains entrenched, that all they have to do to control a democracy is maintain control over the money and the media.

When we talk about ‚Äúdemocracy,‚Äù we are simply talking about ‚Äúrule by a hidden group of Jews.‚Äù



No one is allowed to say ‚ÄúJews control everything‚Äù because Jews do control everything. If they didn‚Äôt control everything, then they could easily just laugh it off. Instead, they come down on you like they‚Äôve come down on me and everyone else who has gone out there and said this in recent years. You get kicked off the internet, banned from everything, they sue you, they try to arrest you on trumped up fake charges.

Imagine if someone went out there and said that the Japanese or Samoans secretly control America. No one would care. Alex Jones says that Chinese control America, and no one cares about that.

Instead, he gets attacked for talking about black crime, supporting the First and Second Amendment, etc. They even call him an anti-Semite, despite how hard he tries to avoid that, because he talks about ‚Äúglobalists‚Äù and ‚Äúinternational bankers.‚Äù I have never seen a mainstream news article that attacked Jones for saying Chinese people control America, and I have never seen an article about me that didn‚Äôt attack me for saying Jews control America.

The reason you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúJews control America‚Äù is because it‚Äôs true, and if you say it, you find out just how true it is when the entire world comes down on your neck.

The key to removing Jews from power is simply showing people that they are in power. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the only job we have.",1,aipac boycott hoax democrat all met with aipac jew master privat,aipac boycott hoax democrat all met with aipac jew master privatelyth entir american jewish media wa claim that the progress democrat presidenti candid skip the meet of the zionist occup govern overlord at aipac meanwhil the isra press is report that they all had secret meet with thi council of jewish overlord which is wors give a public speech to a foreign bodi of elit overlord or meet with those foreign overlord secretli while pretend to the goyim that you are not beholden to that cryptocraci In actual fact the entir concept of aipac have thi confer is outdat the realiti of jewish rule is that it onli work when peopl are told they are not be rule by jew So have all of these politician go to a confer and publicli pledg allegi to a foreign power realli wa not fit for thi model of govern by conspiraci It wa possibl in a pre internet era to have these confer and not have anyon see the video but now that we can see the video wow http www haaretz com us news after boycott claim four democrat presidenti hope meet aipac deleg chuck schumer declar that he wa the guardian of israel at an aipac confer At an aipac adjac jewish occup govern confer nanci pelosi declar that if the american capitol crumbl we would still send billion of dollar to israel I think the jew realiz thi is a problem when ilhan omar went out there and said aipac and they had to call her an anti semit spread anti semit canard for simpli mention that the organ exist peopl were like well if thi is a hate canard then what the fuck are these video of politician swear allegi to israel about they were realli push the limit of realiti itself by tri to claim that it is an act of hatr to simpli say that thi organ exist and that american politician go there and pledg to serv thi foreign countri In fact I have never seen anyth like it jewish rule is predic on the fact that peopl do not know they are be rule by jew there is noth that actual even compar to thi in histori histor there wa alway a king who you knew wa in charg and if you knew that the buck stop with him If you had a grievanc about someth that wa happen in the countri the respons of address it ultim fell on the king democraci realli is a jewish invent becaus in thi system no one can ever be held respons for anyth peopl have a need to point at some individu or group of individu respons for thing that are happen and in democraci no one realli know where to point everyon that you tri to point at can alway point at someon els and then in the background of all of it there are these jew move through the shadow and manipul all event thi is whi democraci ha becom the highest moral valu in a system run by jew and it is whi they attempt to spread it throughout the world use war jew know that becaus the head of state in a democraci is mere a figurehead for a massiv bureaucraci and can be vote in and out whenev the peopl tire of them while the bureaucraci remain entrench that all they have to do to control a democraci is maintain control over the money and the media when we talk about democraci we are simpli talk about rule by a hidden group of jew No one is allow to say jew control everyth becaus jew do control everyth If they didn t control everyth then they could easili just laugh it off instead they come down on you like they ve come down on me and everyon els who ha gone out there and said thi in recent year you get kick off the internet ban from everyth they sue you they tri to arrest you on trump up fake charg imagin if someon went out there and said that the japanes or samoan secretli control america No one would care alex jone say that chines control america and no one care about that instead he get attack for talk about black crime support the first and second amend etc they even call him an anti semit despit how hard he tri to avoid that becaus he talk about globalist and intern banker I have never seen a mainstream news articl that attack jone for say chines peopl control america and I have never seen an articl about me that didn t attack me for say jew control america the reason you can t say jew control america is becaus it s true and if you say it you find out just how true it is when the entir world come down on your neck the key to remov jew from power is simpli show peopl that they are in power that s it that s the onli job we have

For almost three years since 9/11 independent researchers have stockpiled individual smoking guns which prove that the official version of events was not only a lie but operationally impossible.

However, no single smoking gun has yet been forwarded to explain why air defenses categorically reversed Standard Operating Procedure and failed to respond to hijacked jetliners.

Until now. More and more individuals are looking at the facts and highlighting exercise drills that took place on the morning of 9/11.

It is clear that at least five if not six training exercises were in operation in the days leading up to and on the morning of 9/11. This meant that NORAD radar screens showed as many as 22 hijacked airliners at the same time. NORAD had been briefed that this was part of the exercise drill and therefore normal reactive procedure was forestalled and delayed.

The large numbers of 'blips' on NORAD screens that displayed both real and 'drill' hijacked planes explain why confused press reports emerged hours after the attack stating that up to eight planes had been hijacked. [Click here](http://www.rense.com/general13/up.htm) for that article.

The drill scenario also explains a comment made by air traffic control personnel which was featured in a July 2004 BBC television report. [Click here](http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/july2004/220704flightcontroller.htm) for that video clip and article. The controller is told that a hijacked airliner is heading for New York and responds by saying, ""is this real world or an exercise?""

Alex Jones was one of the first to highlight the wargames in his documentary film 'Masters of Terror', which was released in August 2002. [Click here](http://www.prisonplanet.tv/video/masters_clip.WMV) to watch a video clip. Alex explains why the [Associated Press](http://www.prisonplanet.com/agency_planned_exercise_on_sept_11_built_around_a_plane_crashing_into_a_building.htm) later had to admit the fact that the CIA were running drills of crashing planes into buildings on the morning of 9/11.

**What were the drills called and what was their nature?**

&gt;1) OPERATION NORTHERN VIGILANCE: This was planned months in advance of 9/11 and ensured that on the morning of 9/11, jet fighters were removed from patrolling the US east coast and sent to Alaska and Canada, therefore reducing the amount of fighter planes available to protect the east coast.  
2) BIOWARFARE EXERCISE TRIPOD II: Alex Jones first reported on this back in May when Rudolph Giuliani let the details of it slip in his testimony to the 9/11 Commission. FEMA arrived in New York on September 10th to set up a command post located at Pier 29 under the auspices of a 'biowarfare exercise scheduled for September 12. This explains why Tom Kenney of FEMA's National Urban Search and Rescue Team, [told Dan Rather of CBS News](http://www.prisonplanet.com/fema_clip.mp3) that FEMA had arrived in New York on the night of September 10th. This was originally dismissed as a slip of the tongue. Giuliani was to use this post as a command post on 9/11 after he evacuated WTC Building 7. As we [reported back in January](http://www.prisonplanet.com/011904wtc7.html), Giuliani knew when to leave WTC 7 because he got advanced warning that the Trade Towers were about to collapse. ""We were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was gonna collapse,"" Rudolph Giuliani told Peter Jennings of ABC News. How did Giuliani know the towers were about to collapse when no steel building in history had previously collapsed from fire damage?  
üì∑3) OPERATION VIGILANT GUARDIAN: This exercise simulated hijacked planes in the north eastern sector and started to coincide with 9/11. Lt. Col. Dawne Deskins, NORAD unit's airborne control and warning officer, was overseeing the exercise. At 8:40am she took a call from Boston Center which said it had a hijacked airliner. Her first words, as quoted by Newhouse News Service were, ""It must be part of the exercise."" This is another example of how the numerous drills on the morning of 9/11 deliberately distracted NORAD so that the real hijacked planes couldn't be intercepted in time.  
4) OPERATION NORTHERN GUARDIAN: The details of this exercise are still scant but it is considered to be part of Vigilant Guardian, relating to simulating hijacked planes in the north eastern sector.  
5) OPERATION VIGILANT WARRIOR: This was referenced in Richard Clarke's book 'Against All Enemies'. It is thought to have been the 'attack' component of the Vigilant Guardian exercise.

Another example of how air defenses were purposefully kept preoccupied so they couldn't protect New York was [reported by this website](http://www.propagandamatrix.com/051203atlanticcityfighters.html) in December of 2003. The Air National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing, based at Atlantic City International Airport in Pomona, were just eight minutes away from New York and could have intercepted both Flight 11 and Flight 175.

Under NORAD procedures that date to the Cold War, two F-16 fighters from the 177th were parked around the clock on the Atlantic City runway. Pilots waited in a nearby building, ready to scramble.

But on the morning of 9/11, the F-16's were performing bombing runs over an empty stretch of the Pine Barrens near Atlantic City after being decommissioned from their usual role of protecting the skies of the east coast.

It was only after both trade towers were hit that the two F-16s landed and were refitted with air-to-air missiles, then sent aloft.

Now that we have established how NORAD were confused, delayed and distracted by the numerous wargames, the next question to ask is who if anyone was aware of which planes were 'real world' and which planes were 'exercise'? The answer to this question will provide us with the name of the individual who ran the operational execution of the 9/11 attack.

 Evil Is Invisible, part 3

A talk by Vernon Howard given on 12-21-85 

&amp;#x200B;

""Story time following the themes that we have covered. There was once a big country, and this country had a national ball game. Just like we have football and baseball and other sports. National ball game. Everybody played it from the children in the lots next door to the school grounds to the big national teams that engage in this ball game. Everybody played it. Real exciting. Everybody watched it on television on Sunday afternoon. 

There was a scientist, a medical scientist who studied human injuries like in traffic accidents and in factories. And he made a study of this national ball game which was enormously popular. And he noticed something that had never been noticed before. And he attended the ball games and he made notes and put them into his computer and he got on his typewriter. And he wrote out some papers on this ball game. And presented them to the public. And here is what these discoveries were all about. He made it clear that though no one noticed it, the injuries, severe injuries, to the athletes playing this game were far more numerous than anyone knew.

 After a game and a certain team won, it wasn't mentioned that three players had to be carried off on stretchers, paralyzed and seriously hurt by the violence of the game. That was a pretty rough game. No one heard about the serious injuries, but his report stated it. And he sent it to newspapers, anyone who would listen. Was a guest on television shows, and he pointed out what a violent game this was, an awful lot of people were getting hurt out there in the field. That was just the beginning, because he had a good mind. He could look and analyze and dissect things clearly.

He also pointed out that because this game was so violent and people took sides with their team against the other team that there were both major disturbances among the spectators and major riots ‚Äì minor disturbances and major riots. Some of the riots, a lot of people were killed. They'd go crazy when the referee called a decision they didn't like against their team, they rioted. They threw bottles and threw pop cans. They hit each other and even crossed the field. You know, one team audience on one side and the other fans on the other side, they would cross the field and start fighting with each other.

 But the media didn't play that up at all. They kept it very quiet. But the report ‚Äì no question about it. There was something very much wrong with what was going on. Hundreds of times a week all over the nation people were just getting hurt, and some of them never came back to a game after they got in one of these riots, and the players didn't come back to play again the next game because they were out of commission all together. Put his paper out.

 Well, he was a good scientist, but he didn't know human nature. So he was surprised when nobody paid attention. Here he was ‚Äì wouldn't you like to know if members of your family getting hurt in doing something. You would want to know. He put the information out and nobody seemed to care. It was ignored. He couldn't believe it. 

I mean it was just like, you know, in wartime you would say war is bad, right? War kills soldiers and hurts civilians too. He was stunned by the lack of reaction to his astounding expos√© of the violence and the injuries over what had been a very popular national game. No one had ever brought it out before. There it is and nobody paid any attention. He couldn't believe it. So he, ""Oh well,"" he said, ""I haven't told enough newspapers. I haven't been interviewed on radio and television enough. I will redouble my efforts. Run a few ads too."" And he did. No response. 

No outcries of indignation over we've got to change the rules on this game to make it a right game. And he even offered the rules. Ten rules on how to make this an enjoyable game. You are given ten rules, a thousand rules on how to change from a violent life to a healthy, peaceful and fun filled life. Aren't you? Again no response. As a matter of fact the very opposite of what he expected to happen happened to him. One day after working hard telling everybody this awfulness that was going on. The pain ‚Äì you know what it is to get physically hurt. A thousand times worse than people ever imagined. Nobody paid attention.

 One day he went home. And he took out mail out of the mailbox, and he looked at one letter. It didn't have a return address on it. He looked it up and opened it, and it was a threat against his life. This letter said, ""If you don't stop publishing your exposure of our beloved national game, you are going to get it."" He knew what they meant. They're going to go after him. 

And that was just the start. Instead of appreciation and praise for his discoveries that would have lead to more help for more people, instead of that he was threatened. Hate letters. They increased in volume. He noticed that the reporters didn't want to interview him anymore. They saw his persistence and they did not want that. He wouldn't be written up in the papers. They didn't want him on radio and television anymore. And he didn't understand it. You understand it. Don't you? You know what I am talking about. 

So here he was trying to do a good thing, and the opposite happened. Now he was being viciously attacked and the lies ‚Äì you wouldn't believe the lies they told about him. ""What are you getting out of this? You are just a show-off. You want to see your name in the papers."" Every possible kind of lie, falsehood and slander and viciousness. 

He went from understanding scientific principles about the national ball game to understanding something about human nature. Began to get a little suspicious that people weren't at all what he thought they were. You know why he thought that, don't you? Because he thought he was a nice man. And what a shock he had to go through to see that he did have a lot of egotism in himself that he hadn't uncovered. Now he is beginning to understand the other evil by first understanding self evil. Which was a shock but he knew it was a healthy one. He was a good student of the lessons that everyday life had to give to him.  

He said, ""All right. I have investigated the ball game and came out with some astonishing and shocking facts. Now I am going to investigate why nobody wants to be saved from being hurt, from the riots, and all the heartache that comes from human beings hurting each other both on the field and in the stand. ""I am going to find out what is going on. I don't know what is going on, but I am going to find out."" 

You know what he found out? What we have been talking about up to this point. About evil being invisible. Something you don't see. There is an evil headquarters. You can call it Hell if you want. An evil headquarters that is sending up its messages and instructing its evil spirits to inhabit human beings to try to prevent them from getting healthy. He began to understand this, so he did some investigation. You know what he found out? Here is what he found out. He discovered what was really in back of not only just the resistance, but the violent hatred and attack on him for exposing the ball game as it was now played. He found out that there were manufacturers of ball game equipment, uniforms, the balls themselves, all the equipment necessary for the game. He found out that those manufacturers of the game were behind it. They didn't want to change the rules. They didn't want the game to become safer. If it became safer, then they would lose money in one way or another. 

He found out that the operators of the stadium, that nice smiling man who appeared and who welcomed the hundred thousand top the ball game smiling with a flower in his lapel, and he was one of the city officials. That man had an interest in the commercialization of the stadium itself and all the concessions, the popcorn and the peanuts and all that. There is a lot of money in that. 

One hundred thousand people in one stadium several times a month, and that is duplicated all over. There is a lot of money in that. The operators of the stadium, of the equipment, the parking lots, the cafes surrounding the stadium. Before and after people go and they have their drinks and they have their dinners. Nobody wanted the situation changed because they would lose out financially. But do you think they are going to come right out and say that in public? Of course not.

 In order to continue to make a profit from the game as it is now played, in order to get money, and power and position, what do they care if thousands of human beings are wounded in the mob violence. What do they care if the players are hauled off and never come back? What do they care? They have what they wanted. Invisible evil works like that. 

Now your exercise, your work is to take today's talk from the start and work up to this example I gave you and you are to look and see how true it is in all human affairs. What if there are ways to abolish crime? How many people would be put out of work? What would all the policemen and the wardens and the judges and the lawyers do for a living if crime was abolished? Crime is a national pastime. It is a sport. You abolish it, then what is going to happen to the income of all of these people? It is going to vanish.  

Are you understanding it? I know you are. Are you ever going to look at any human being again and think that he or she is what he or she pretends he or she is? You are never going to do it again. And the reason that you are never going to do it again is because you have followed the spiritual law ""Look at yourself first."" If you don't do that, you will remain one of the greedy, vicious owners of the stadium or the manufacturers of the equipment or the owners of the bars, and you will want your reward whether it is financial or popularity, approval, whatever it might be. You will want your reward from this world. Which means that you won't have a reward from the other world. 

I know you don't understand what that means yet to have a spiritual reward, something that is higher than what you are getting now. But you will understand it if you perform the exercise until you shockingly come face to face with your petty greed. With your wish to get a nickel.

 See, you see it is not the nickel that counts, it is the ""I won"" that counts, and it is not even the ""I won,"" but the feeling that ""I exist"" that counts. 

None of those greedy merchants are ever going to track their own sickness, neurosis back to that point. They are never going to do it. They are not going to wake up. You are here to wake up, not to continue to be one of the greedy merchants. Your exercise is clear to you. Track it way back. Until you understand quite clearly that evil is invisible and its purpose is to prevent other human beings from waking up. And they don't go around saying that to themselves, because evil is unconscious of itself. It's built in to it. Work on the exercise and take a break.""",1,evil is invis part final part,evil is invis part final partpart http www reddit com r conspiraci comment b ahoa evil is invis part http www reddit com r

Only what is most agreed on, like no hurting people and no stealing etc, should be laws, but if for example 30% of congress is against the law banning marijuana then they can repeal it, even though it takes 90% of congress to ban something. The people have all freedoms not banned by laws, so it is doable to make things harder to ban than allow. For example, you wouldnt create a law legalizing jaywalking. A law is something you can be sentenced for, so that doesnt make sense. You cant be sentenced for breaking that law. You can only be sentenced (in theory if cops believed in giving tickets for it) for a ban on jaywalking. It should take 90% agreement to ban jaywalking and 30% to allow it.

548,Nail in the coffin: Why nobody should believe Jussie Smollet,0,"Nail in the coffin: Why nobody should believe Jussie SmolletJussie Smollett's 16 charges were dropped, as it was determined that he was telling the truth about his attack.

This is a blatant demonstration of the inevitable flaws in our current justice system. Any reasonable person can see that his actions are not consistent with somebody who has endured this psychological trauma- not only the strange attack but also the shame he underwent for America calling him a liar.

Let's assume, for the sake of this discussion, that Jussie Smollett has been telling the truth all along.

Jussie Smollett is an innocent, black, gay actor doing well in a critically-acclaimed television show. One day, he receives a letter at work- something that looks like a ransom note a six year old made, saying ""You will die black f\*g"" with a drawing of a gun shooting a hanging person.

That's fucking rude. But he soldiers on, as the hero he is. One week later, at around 2am near his apartment, two masked men pour bleach on him, wrap a noose around his neck, tells him ""This MAGA country, n\*\*\*a,"" and punch him.

Jussie appears on television and tells his story. He is [reluctant to report the incident to police](https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-alleged-jussie-smollett-attack/story?id=61124090), and when they arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope. Remember, he is telling the truth, so we'll assume he's in a deep state of self-deprecating despair. He is partying in his palace of pity- okay, fair enough.

Seventeen days after the attack, the news is telling everyone that the attackers claim they were paid. They are implying Jussie is a liar. It appears this story makes sense to America and they begin gratuitously shaming him. Imagine being our hero on this day, how angry it must have made him to hear this atrocious, abhorrent nonsense!

But the police are convinced he's lying. Jussie gets arrested for filing false police reports! What is this shit- I'm the victim here!!

Instead of addressing the lies, and clearing his name of all of the slander- Jussie hides and hires one of the most prestigious lawyers in the world. He doesn't assert his truth and pay a regular rich lawyer to defend him. He hides and hires Mark Geragos- known for taking the legal wheel when an obviously guilty rich person is in deep shit. He defended Chris Brown for beating Rihanna, Colin Kaepernick for protesting NFL, William Lych- a priest accused of molestation, Michael Jackson for alleged molestation, Winona Ryder for shoplifting, with many more big names.

So we are Jussie Smollett in court hearing that our sixteen charges have been dropped. Finally, they believe me! SHIT! I'm relieved, but mostly I'm fucking pissed. My reputation has been crucified and these lawyer fees have been kicking my ass. I can't wait to get the counter-lawsuits going! They fucked me and it's time to take what's mine!!

But no- he doesn't seem to feel angry at all. He continues to hide. The police are looking to collect north of $100,000 from Jussie to cover the investigation costs. Shouldn't Jussie be looking to collect north of $5M to cover his tarnished reputation based on their lies?

**His actions are not consistent with somebody who has been telling the truth since day one.**

The media will use this news as an opportunity to condemn conspiracy theorists. They will say things like, ""look, we thought there was a conspiracy and we were wrong. Conspiracies are fake and people who believe in them are wrong.""

Until Jussie gets angry, he's not playing his part correctly. He is willing to elaborately deceive in order to manipulate the masses.

The submission pose was slightly altered along with the new equipment so everyone that has passed through before and after the transition would have had to have noticed the change.   The personal property tray collector is akin to a school cafeteria's and seemed to really struggle when I burdened it with all the cluttered trays I collected from other passengers and fed it.   I doubt this is equipment that is built to last or perform at a high level when working properly.   The four black spires that are shaped like classic guard towers and look intimidating and lord over the cue seem to only contain a dimmed light bulb in their center when you look past the mesh work.   These towers could contain those dragnet thingys that slurp cell data from the unassuming but to me it looked like a prop - just something to fill in the space and have a certain psychological effect.

Tens of thousands of people pass through here weekly and see the same thing - I can't be the only one who has noticed how chintzy it all looks and feels.   Is the poor design and cheap facade as intentional as the numerous other mockeries at DIA?

558,Youtube censoring it's content creators is mildly worrying to me,0,"Youtube censoring it's content creators is mildly worrying to meI have recently observed how youtube is slowly but steadily starting to censor channels. this is mostly regarding profanity and things like that. Now obviously they don't straight up remove or change videos that are uploaded, but what they do is that when they see a video that has too much swearing they say ""We can't monetize your video until you remove the profanity"". And since they need to get paid they oblige. Most don't really have a choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent example i've seen of this is [Angry Joes video on BFV](https://youtu.be/ywfK3_cW3pU). And to me he seems kinda exhausted by the whole concept of having to censor his videos because he can't swear. But guess what anger and swearing is a part of his image and partially what made him famous. I don't like that this censoring is forcing creators to change their image and identity. 

&amp;#x200B;

One other example i've seen of this is when Pewdiepie said in a video that since he stopped swearing and talking about edgy and controversial subjects his problem with YT and monetization has faded away. Now on one hand that's great for him that he get's his videos monetized, but on the other hand also he is slightly changing his image to fit what youtube wants him to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the reason i'm only mildly worried is that this is as I perceive it only the very small and seemingly insignificant start. But that's the point, start with the smallest of altercations and as such the subjects of the censoring wont even notice. Gradually build up more and more restrictions and censoring and nobody at all will notice. And i mean it's kinda brilliant in the sense that they have the creators gladly accepting the censorship because they are already so damn tired of having their income terminated. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is how it has always been done throughout history. Successful censorship builds up overtime and as i mentioned earlier no one will notice and perhaps they will even embrace it with open arms.",1,youtub censor it s content creator is mildli worri to me,youtub censor it s content creator is mildli worri to mei have recent observ how youtub is slowli but steadili start to censor channel thi is mostli regard profan and thing like that now obvious they don t straight up remov or chang video that are upload but what they do is that when they see a video that ha too much swear they say We can t monet your video until you remov the profan and sinc they need to get paid they oblig most don t realli have a choic amp x B the most recent exampl i ve seen of thi is angri joe video on bfv http youtu be ywfk cW pU and to me he seem kinda exhaust by the whole concept of have to censor hi video becaus he can t swear but guess what anger and swear is a part of hi imag and partial what made him famou I don t like that thi censor is forc creator to chang their imag and ident amp x B one other exampl i ve seen of thi is when pewdiepi said in a video that sinc he stop swear and talk about edgi and controversi subject hi problem with YT and monet ha fade away now on one hand that s great for him that he get s hi video monet but on the other hand also he is slightli chang hi imag to fit what youtub want him to be amp x B now the reason i m onli mildli worri is that thi is as I perceiv it onli the veri small and seemingli insignific start but that s the point start with the smallest of alterc and as such the subject of the censor wont even notic gradual build up more and more restrict and censor and nobodi at all will notic and i mean it s kinda brilliant in the sens that they have the creator gladli accept the censorship becaus they are alreadi so damn tire of have their incom termin amp x B thi is how it ha alway been done throughout histori success censorship build up overtim and as i mention earlier no one will notic and perhap they will even embrac it with open arm

Capitalism = pooling private money to attain private objectives.

Socialism = pooling public money to attain pubic objectives.

There is not enough time on earth for a socialist victory over capitalism.

All you have to do to tame capitalism is to tax wealth.

You do not need to wear a mask to smash the fash.
Fascism infects both capitalism and socialism.

574,The Internet Is Too Dangerous To Be Left Alone As Is.,0,"The Internet Is Too Dangerous To Be Left Alone As Is.There is a major push going on in the West right now to censor what information we are exposed to. In many western nations, this will succeed. Because of the 1st Amendment in the US, those who would wish to restrict information from the public will bump up against walls not found in other parts of the world. The alternative to censorship is to heavily dilute the truth with many lies, to metaphorically hide the needle in a haystack.

At some point in the near future, you will see the marketplace of ideas flooded with many fakes. Here‚Äôs how you avoid them:

1. They will try to grind away at your time. Beware of any overly long videos &amp; articles. Your time is valuable. Pay attention to repetition. You can detect actors if you try. Don‚Äôt waste your time listening to people reciting scripts intended to suck your attention from things that matter.

2. Overly slick production. When someone comes out of nowhere and has an expensive looking setup, they have financial backers and you have no reason to trust the motives of those backers. Many of these will be domestic or foreign military intelligence officers posing as independent journalists.

3. Immediately after some important accusation or claim is made, the marketplace of ideas is flooded with many outrageous ideas. The intention is to divert attention and to distract from the real to to the false. For example: story breaks about John X engaging in a sex crime. Next day many other things hit the news that can take the spotlight off his unfortunate situation.

We need to be vigilant. Truth seeking in the future will still be possible but it will grow in levels of complexity.

581,"The eerie Seth MacFarlane coincidences- New episode showing ""Holy Christ Church"" on fire",0,"The eerie Seth MacFarlane coincidences- New episode showing ""Holy Christ Church"" on fireSeth MacFarlane has a great gift of comedic sensibility and a massive engine that reaches the entire world. We almost lost him on 9/11; he was booked to be on one of the planes that hit the towers, but his travel agent had told him an inaccurate time, and due to feeling hungover from a night of drinking, his life was saved.

As a result we‚Äôre still able to enjoy his art today in the form of television, music and movies.

I want to take you down the road of a conspiracy theory. It will absolutely be brushed off by over half of you, but regardless I‚Äôm going to guide you down the rabbit-hole.

It was a bad coincidence that he was scheduled to be on that flight. When the Elite Powers That Be saw his name on the flight list, they intercepted communication between Seth and his travel agent. They ensured that he was given the wrong time so he would not be killed.

His show Family Guy had already been on the air for two years, and young Seth MacFarlane was a valuable asset to the Elite. Anyone and everyone who was communicating to the masses must be in their control. If they are able to control the entertainment we consume, they can keep our minds in check, and ensure their agenda is being followed.

Here are strange coincidences of his shows, which take 9-12 months to produce, eerily depicting real life events:

**#1: New Zealand Shooting - Family Guy**

On 3/24/19, ""You Can't Handle the Booth"", we see CHRIST terrorizing CHURCH-goers. The exterior shot shows the church burned down and we can see the [name of the church](http://oi66.tinypic.com/154jztf.jpg): ""Holy CHRIST CHURCH."" Later in the episode, we see Peter, one white man, among a large group of Muslims [looking nervous](http://oi63.tinypic.com/24l24j9.jpg). The shooting happened on 3/15/19. Family Guy did not air a new episode on its regularly scheduled slot on 3/17/19, despite Bob's Burgers and Simpsons both airing a new episode on that day. It's likely Fox delayed the episode because of these images; this would not be the first time they've pulled MacFarlane's shows [following a massacre.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/family-guy-american-dad-pulled-by-fox-sandy-hook-school-shooting_n_2306911)

**#2: New Zealand Shooting - American Dad** 

3/25/19, Funnyish Games - an episode all about home security, appearing to metaphorize national security. It opens with Francine reading her phone and laughing hysterically at the news of their middle-eastern neighbors being robbed and brutally pistol-whipped. Later, Stan orchestrates a fake home invasion to convince Francine they need better home security (orchestrating false flags to convince population they need better national security.) Francine: ""I can't sleep since the home-invasion!"" Stan: ""Ah, you mean the eye-opening demonstration?"" Later in the episode, we see Stan's home [shooting at a Muslim](http://oi64.tinypic.com/330d54l.jpg) in the name of home security.

**#3: Boston Marathon - Family Guy**

On 03/17/13, the episode Turban Cowboy aired featuring Peter meeting a terrorist and subsequently becoming one. In one scene, Peter presses a button on a phone that his new friend gave him and an explosion, followed by screams are heard. Peter presses another button, and we hear a second explosion, followed by more screams.

Later in the episode, we see an eerie joke about Peter driving his car through marathon runners, leaving a trail of blood and dead bodies. It cuts to Peter describing how he won the Boston Marathon to a TV interviewer, revealing that he was committing mass murder at the Boston Marathon.

A month later, on 04/15/13, the Boston Marathon Bombing occurred, which included two blasts.

**#4: Boston Marathon - American Dad**

Two days before the bombing, on 4/13/13, American Dad released an episode with the following dialogue:

Hailey: I gotta be honest with you Snot, I wasn't really looking forward to this night, but I had a blast.

Snot: Well, call the bomb squad! Cuz with the blast I had, that makes TWO blasts!! (visually shows 2 fingers) \*creepy laugh\*

**#5: Robin Williams suicide - Family Guy**

On 05/20/12, an episode aired featuring Peter as a King Midas-like character, except everything he touches turns to Robin Williams. The fiasco becomes too much for Peter to handle, and he tries repeatedly to commit suicide, each attempt being stopped by Robin Williams. In one visual, we see Peter putting a gun to his head, but the gun turns into a Robin Williams.

On 08/11/14, while news was being reported that Robin Williams had committed suicide, the BBC3 network happened to be playing this episode.

**#6: Virginia Tech Shooting - American Dad**

The episode ""Vacation Goo"" was originally set to air on 04/29/07. There was a scene where Stan was wearing a ""V TECH"" shirt and was shouting ""Hokies!"" at the screen to root on Virginia Tech's football team.

The shooting happened on 04/16/07, so the scene was reanimated and the whole episode was pushed back so fans wouldn't think they were making fun of the tragedy.

**#7: Bruce Jenner‚Äôs transition - Family Guy**

In an episode from 2009, after Stewie is told that Bruce Jenner is a man, he replies with ""No, Brian. That‚Äôs what the press would have you believe, but he‚Äôs not. Bruce Jenner is a woman. An elegant, beautiful Dutch woman.""In another episode from 2011, Jenner is seen flamboyantly dancing in front of Navy men who are cheering him on as if he is a sexy woman.

In 2015, we of course got the news about Caitlyn Jenner.

**#8: Kevin Spacey allegations - Family Guy**

In 2005 an episode was aired where Stewie runs through a mall screaming that he needs help because he has escaped from Kevin Spacey‚Äôs basement. The allegations came out in 2017.

**#9: Death of Paul Walker - Family Guy**

On 11/24/13, an episode was aired where Seth spontaneously killed off a very integral character, Brian, when he was hit by a car. On 11/30/13, the character of Brian from Fast of The Furious, Paul Walker, died in a car crash.

**#10: Harvey Weinstein allegations - The 2013 Oscars**

During a monologue before an award in 2013, Seth makes a joke about how the women nominated no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein. The allegations came forth in October 2017.

**#11: Bret Ratner allegations - Family Guy**

In a 2012 episode, we see Stewie dressed as a girl showing off for bidders, apparently for sex trafficking. Brett Ratner bids $75k on Stewie. In November of 2017, six women came forward accusing him of sexual assault.

**#12: Death of George H.W. Bush - Family Guy**

George Herbert Walker Bush died on 11/30/18. Two days later on 12/2/18, The long running character of Herbert, who uses a walker, is killed off. Despite it seeming like the end of Herbert, he popped up on a 3/24/19 episode, making the death episode stranger.

I agree that some of these are most likely mere coincidences but I theorize that some of these things were either Seth himself warning us, or the Elite specifically telling him to include a certain scene or joke.

587,MSM posting fake posts on reddit for stories.,0,"MSM posting fake posts on reddit for stories.Everyone has noticed an increase in reddit posts being used for articles in the MSM. I believe they are posting the posts themselves to generate articles. 

I also believe reddit may be conspiring with them on this as the more articles posted with content from reddit will increase traffic (and therefore advertising revenue) to the site.

I believe at the beginning, the MSM were reporting stories from subreddits like Relationships, AMITA and Choosy Beggers etc that were posted by actual redditors, but when they couldn't find any more content, they began making up their own. 

I'm not usually a conspiracy person, so I don't think this is a deliberate attempt to avoid reporting on ""real news"", however this is an obvious repercussion of doing so. I do believe it is about money, from both sides.

592,Quick Question Re: QANON Beliefs,0,"Quick Question Re: QANON BeliefsHi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Have been interested in conspiracy theories all my life - been aware of QAnon movement for a while but haven't taken the time to really dig in to the non-surface level stuff. Caveat - I know that not everyone believes the same thing, looking for sentiment of the majority. If there are offshoot ideas that are supported by a solid number of people I'm interested in that too.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help clarify general beliefs on ""upstart"" politicians (for lack of a better word) like Bernie Sanders? Or even AOC? I mean, it seems like QAnon believes that Donald Trump is bucking the system - and that that is a positive. Wouldn't they support Sanders and AOC as because they are political figures that the establishment also tries to suppress?

&amp;#x200B;

Do people take issue with Bernie being in politics for decades, despite him not seeing much success? Is AOC's lack of support in this regard because they believe that her followers are mostly SJW types? Her policies seem pretty antithetical to what current Dems and Repubs want. Or am I totally misreading QAnon's core belief (that we need to revamp American society/politics as it currently functions)?

&gt;[President of the Muslim Association of Canterbury] said an electrician had tested the new electric locking system on Thursday, and then disengaged it for Friday prayers. He said that to open the door, somebody needed to turn a lever. It was just happenstance, and perhaps the cool weather that day, he said, which meant the door wasn't wide open as usual.  
&gt;""On any other Friday, the door would be open,"" he said.

&gt;...

&gt;When the gunman began to attack the Al Noor mosque, Ahmed Alayedy scrambled to get to the nearest emergency exit.  
&gt;He was the first one there.  
&gt;""I tried to open the door,"" he said.  
&gt;""But it doesn't open.""

&gt;...

&gt;Another survivor, Khaled Alnobani, says he thinks as many as 17 people may have died trying to get out through the door.  
&gt;Investigators have likely examined a new electric locking system installed on the door in the days before the attack. The mosque says an electrician disabled that system the day before the attack, although some of those who escaped question whether that was the case. What is clear is that nobody managed to open the door that afternoon.

I really think that transparency is the key to moderation. The single biggest thing that /r/conspiracy can do right now to improve moderation in the sub is to bring the public mod logs back online. 

The fact these can no longer be publicly viewed is really damaging to the single most important tool that keeps moderators honest and prevents abuse of power. Transparency. 

When people here have the ability to have an eagles eye view of which moderators are removing what comments, or which moderators are not removing comments, it‚Äôs a lot less likely that a person will take their comment or post being removed personally or feel that they‚Äôre being targeted or excluded from the conversation. For the mods to have a track record to be able to point back to and show they‚Äôve consistently removed similar comments and posts, is so beneficial to the mods and the users. 

You can easily identify an out-of-control moderator through the public mod logs. In addition to the logs, having moderators be accountable to other moderators is also a great way to keep everyone honest.

625,Incitement to violence - Dual Standards?,0,"Incitement to violence - Dual Standards?So half the planet (at least governments, news agencies and tech giants) are falling over themselves trying to make sure nobody gets to look at the New Zealand shooter's manifesto for fear that reading about why he did it might inspire others to do the same.

And yet [on the front page of Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b6lu43/the_boy_who_tried_to_kill_trump_2018_in_2016/) we have a post highlighting a documentary outlining why someone wanted to kill Donald Trump and how they tried to do it. Personally, I don't think either should be censored from public view but if there is any sort of honest fear on the part of those trying to hide the NZ Manifesto, how can they not find material like this just as likely to inspire others to acts of political violence? You also have Youtube and the Wall Street Journal showing [ISIS recruitment videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmnuE98kgMY). (this was merely the first one I found, I'm sure you can find pure ISIS videos on Youtube without much effort).

630,"Prosecutors say they have tapes of telephone calls between the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and three of his accused co-conspirators talking in code about the plot months before it took place, a defense lawyer disclosed on Monday.",0,"Prosecutors say they have tapes of telephone calls between the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and three of his accused co-conspirators talking in code about the plot months before it took place, a defense lawyer disclosed on Monday.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/politics/9-11-khalid-shaikh-mohammed.html

&gt;GUANT√ÅNAMO BAY, Cuba ‚Äî Military prosecutors say they have tapes of telephone calls between the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and three of his accused co-conspirators talking in code about the plot months before it took place, a defense lawyer disclosed on Monday.

&gt;The lawyer, Jay Connell, revealed the existence of the tapes as part of a protest over plans to use them as evidence at the death penalty trial of the alleged conspirators. More than 17 and a half years after the attacks ‚Äî in which 19 hijackers commandeered four commercial airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, killing nearly 3,000 people ‚Äî there is still no date set for the trial in the proceedings at Guant√°namo Bay.

&gt;Prosecutors gave defense lawyers the original audio and transcripts of their translation on Sept. 30, 2016, Mr. Connell said, and made clear they planned to use them at trial. Defense lawyers sought to investigate their origins and later discovered that the original trial judge, Army Col. James L. Pohl, had issued a secret order preventing them from knowing about the phone call collection system or asking questions about it.

&gt;Mr. Connell, who is representing Mr. Mohammed‚Äôs nephew, Ammar al-Baluchi, said that prosecutors secretly obtained a ruling in August 2018 from Colonel Pohl forbidding defense lawyers from learning how the phone calls were collected or investigating that question. The phone calls in at least two languages were made between April and October 2001.

&gt;Mr. Connell said the restriction on investigating the origins of the tapes violated a defendant‚Äôs basic right to challenge the evidence being used against him. He argued in court on Monday that the evidence should be suppressed or that the case should be dismissed. He said the constraints the defense faces regarding the tapes violate the Sixth Amendment, which sets out the rights of defendants in a trial.

&gt;The military trial judges have yet to decide, however, which aspects of the Constitution apply at the military commissions, the war court established by President George W. Bush after the terrorist attacks.

&gt;A prosecutor, Clayton Trivett, responded that defense lawyers would be allowed to question an F.B.I. linguist who compared samples of the voices of the defendants to the voices on the tapes to confirm they were Mr. Mohammed, Mr. al-Baluchi and two other alleged plotters.

&gt;Mr. Trivett said defense lawyers would be allowed to question an F.B.I. analyst who decoded the conversation. The only restriction, he said, is on defense lawyers trying to investigate ‚Äúhow the United States government got those calls,‚Äù something prosecutors persuaded the judge would endanger national security.

&gt;Colonel Pohl had said prosecutors could describe the evidence as having been acquired from ‚Äútelephone calls from between April and October 2001 that were later determined to pertain to the planned attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.‚Äù

&gt;Terry McDermott, co-author of ‚ÄúThe Hunt for KSM,‚Äù said his research found that United States satellites ‚Äúrandomly scooped up‚Äù calls between Mr. Mohammed and an alleged deputy, Ramzi bin al-Shibh. ‚ÄúThe N.S.A. intercepted calls but didn‚Äôt listen to them or translate them until after 9/11,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAfterward, they went through this stuff and found out what it was.‚Äù

&gt;Mr. Trivett did not disclose how or when the F.B.I. got voice samples of the accused plotters. Mr. Connell questioned in court whether they were recorded during the years that Mr. Mohammed and the other the defendants were held in the C.I.A.‚Äôs secret prison system.

&gt;Mr. Trivett announced that the samples were not from the C.I.A. black sites where the five alleged plotters were held before they were brought to Guant√°namo for trial in 2006.

Priorities way out of whack.

644,[Meta] Dear shills: are you fighting the right enemy?,0,"[Meta] Dear shills: are you fighting the right enemy?I noticed a *huge* influx of shills right after New Zealand. The evidence for this is increased numbers of comments, particularly in New Zealand threads, increased aggression on those topics, and a bunch of accounts that are supposedly longtime users that are calling names and doing other things that get them banned quickly (i.e. they're actually newbies using old accounts). 

This post will show them that are not heroic social justice warriors who are bravely fighting evil in the world. They are actually alt-right, white nationalist thugs and Nazis. And they will all read this, because the best way to attract shills is to talk about them.

Dear shills: you are not fighting the right enemy.

You believe the enemy is the ""alt-right."" Do you know who is responsible for the alt right? Richard Spencer is a [federal agent](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/exclusive-report-richard-spencer-confirmed-deep-state-plant/). So is [David Duke](stevepieczenik.com/charlottesville-staged-confrontation/). So, who is really responsible for white nationalism and racism? The government. The Deep State.

You love to mock and ridicule us for denouncing the Deep State. You call us kooks, nuts, racists, alt right, white nationalists, etc. But *you* are the ones defending the alt right. *You* are defending white nationalism. *You* are supporting Richard Spencer. *You* are supporting David Duke.

Many of you think we are crazy to hate George Soros. You know he pays many of your paychecks, and you even admit this while pretending to joke about it. You wouldn't think he's harmless if you knew what he's really about. George Soros [openly admits](https://www.infowars.com/roseanne-is-right-george-soros-is-a-nazi-collaborator/) he was a Nazi collaborator, and stated he does not regret what he did.

&gt;60 Minutes: [You] went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.

&gt;Soros: Yes. That‚Äôs right. Yes.

&gt;60 Minutes: I mean, that‚Äôs ‚Äî that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?

&gt;Soros: Not ‚Äî not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don‚Äôt ‚Äî you don‚Äôt see the connection. But it was ‚Äî it created no ‚Äî no problem at all.

&gt;60 Minutes: No feeling of guilt?

&gt;Soros: No.

He didn't stop being a Nazi in the 1940s. Just a few years ago, he [helped install actual Nazis in Ukraine](http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n08-20170224/04-21_4408.pdf) while working with the US State Department's coup of the elected government. 

When you attack people who are calling out George Soros, you are *literally* defending a Nazi. Next time you go out to punch Nazis, punch yourself. You are [Joseph Goebbels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels).

You are *not* brave social justice warriors. You are [criminals](http://progressivearmy.com/2016/10/08/exposed-clinton-campaign-violated-campaign-finance-laws/). You are defending alt-right Nazis. You are bad people.

You will be much happier if you get another job. McDonald's pays double what you earn on average. You will have the satisfaction of knowing you actually created a good that has economic value. With the extra money, you could go to junior college or trade school, and learn to do something even more valuable. In just a few months, you could be on your way to being a scientist, engineer, carpenter, social worker, teacher, or something else that actually helps people. You will have enough money to move out of your parents' basement.

Just get an application, fill it out, and get yourself a new job. Then, walk into your bosses' office and tell him you found a better job. You don't have to tell him you realized you were a stooge for alt-right Nazis. You don't have to tell your friends you reject the hive mind. Just walk away, and start living a better life.

Long story short, US is going down the drain due to our (un)justice department. From the crimes of Hillary, to those of the DOJ crimes within. 

This is a multi-tiered Justice department. Lady Justice is not only not blind; rather, she is pointing out certain individuals based on who they know and jailing them. At the same time, she is blatantly ignoring crimes right in front of her face.

If there are no laws, let there be anarchy. Burn the rules of law, and let's play ball equally.

Then watch [this fucking music video here](https://youtu.be/HUHC9tYz8ik) then listen to just the music and lyrics. If there's a textbook example of the methods, commands, and conditions of psychological fracturing of a person's mind into disassociated pieces to program their behaviour, it's this. This song is about programming a mind controlled slave. 

The song implies that when you loose consciousness you go to another place and are no longer in your body. That there can be things that happen to your body when you aren't conscious that you won't remember. Apart that could do things you could or would never do. It contains commands to self-harm with screams in the background. It talks about debt owed by their soul, about willing suicide.  About becoming totally subservient to their master to the point of death.

This is a super popular artist with young people. This is what they are being exposed to so blatantly, how can normies still deny what is happening in the music industry and who developed it?

If you think mind control is hyped up bullshit and psychology doesn't work that way read the book *Quantum Psychology* by Robert Anton Wilson. It breaks down exactly how minds can be programmed through behaviour, and especially trauma. [The pdf is here](https://www.pdfdrive.com/quantum-psychology-by-robert-anton-wilson-e36593041.html).

His death fuelled international outrage, but inside Russia the corrupt government officials responsible were never brought to justice. *Justice for Sergei*tells the story of an ordinary man who paid the ultimate price while trying to expose the extraordinary corruption gripping Russia today. 

  
In 2012, the film won the **Cinema for Peace Award for Justice 2012** in Berlin. The film was awarded First Prize in the Human Rights Competition at the 'Docudays' Film Festival in Kiev, Ukraine in 2011. *Justice for Sergei*has been broadcasted in several countries and the 62-minute Director's Cut has been touring major film festivals around the globe.

674,Please Explain how you can possibly take anything Pauline Hanson has ever said seriously,0,"Please Explain how you can possibly take anything Pauline Hanson has ever said seriouslyIt is shocking and saddening watching people discuss the NZ massacre, and attempt to resurrect the failed, flaccid old conspiracies surrounding Port Arthur. It displays an appalling lack of critical thinking.   
The real story behind the footage of Pauline Hanson aired on ABC this week is the fact that it happened during meetings at which the NRA was attempting to buy right-wing Australian politicians, just as they have successfully done in America. This is a sickening development, and a genuine conspiracy: the NRA wants guns in Australia and certain politicians here are happy to sell the safety of our country out.   
Hanson is a laughing stock in Australia with a long history of stupid gimmickry and racism. The politician she quoted from Parliament in 1987 has since come out to explain that his comments have been misunderstood. Hanson herself has since claimed that her quotes were somehow ""taken out of context"" and denied that she believes Port Arthur was a conspiracy.

675,Government/Big tech companies hiding tech?,0,"Government/Big tech companies hiding tech?So my belief is that the government/big tech companies are 10-15yrs advanced than what is actually released to the public. I remember on PBS over 15yrs ago, they where showing how they already had screens that where bendable, the example they had and where showing looked like a thin piece of glass from the front of laptop, it was that size and everything, just thin piece of glass and on one end it was solid and that's where all the wires connected and it actually rolled up like a poster. It was for mobility and portability. But for real just unrolled it and the screen was on. It kind of blew my mind and didn't understand how as a kid, also did a show on cloud seeding and weather manipulation. Again 15yrs+ on PBS, I think it was NOVA. So anyway I was watching small soldiers, and they use a 3D printer to make Chip the Soldier guy, and it looks just like the stereolithography 3D printer that is the new tech. Actually watched video like last week on YouTube so it blew my mind to see it on a movie from when I was a kid. But even the ones now don't print that advanced. So is it just all fake? Or is this one of those showing u the truth right in front of you? Could the movie really show Advanced stereolithography 3D printing in action in a movie from 1998? Or do I need to take off my foil hat?

A user on reddit decided to make a new business. It was a poker room that worked over TOR. He let the mods know in /r/poker about this business and he got insta banned. He soon realized it was because the mods were shilling their own poker room in that subreddit. He soon found out about what all the hostility was about. So as a test this user posted a post talking bad on the business for not being able to work over TOR and to see how it would turn out. It turned out exactly how he expected. He was not only banned from the subreddit for it he was also banned sitewide.

679,Vault 7 Theory,0,"Vault 7 TheoryI think Vault 7 was leaked on purpose, this is for several reasons.

- Only a few dozen exploits were revealed, although they are all pretty impressive, the CIA works in collaboration with US Hardware and Software manufacturers, I would think that they would have many more.

- the Shadow Brokers only leak were files leaked from the CIA TAO, not the NSA, DIA, or AFRL.

What would be the CIAs motive in this?

As many know, only a couple months after the Vault 7 leaks, the Petya cyberattacks and the Wannacry ransom attacks began, despite the fact that Russian banks and the Government were affected by the attacks, the USA and UK blamed Russia for the attacks, 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/uk-blames-russia-notpetya-cyber-attack-ukraine.

The USA holds a huge reserve of Bitcoin, this is mostly from the numerous Deep Web marketplaces they have taken over, but I theorize vast amounts of Bitcoin are held by the US as a result of the Wannacry attacks, perhaps this will be auctioned off, perhaps they are holding it for Economical Warfare purposes.

But why leak Vault 7? Because the CIA and other Intelligence Agency‚Äôs were free to blame anyone they liked because the exploit was easily available to whoever wanted it, there were likely other hackers to use it, but I suspect the USA was the first to spread Malware, the USA has control over almost all Fiber Cables, and Satellites which gives them complete control to the Internet, as a result, installation of this Malware on sensitive networks would be simple due to the NSAs Quantum Exploits which leverage this power.

736,3. What is your vision of /r/conspiracy in general?,0,"3. What is your vision of /r/conspiracy in general?Another question which I answered today that I thought was worth sharing here, and I hope every person who's interested in being a mod here will share publicly. Having a compelling vision, writing it down and revisiting it daily for anything you care deeply about is a very effective way to actually bring about that change.  I'd love to read other responses to this very important question being asked for perspective mods.

3. What is your vision of /r/conspiracy in general?

I found /r/conspiracy on April 15, 2013. Patriots Day. This was also the day of the Boston Marathon Bombings, an event that REALLY put Reddit on the map for a lot of people. I was drawn here by the completely open sourced, hive mind driven manhunt that was taking place by millions of people all over the world, feverishly searching for answers to the sloppy false flag that was unfolding on the television screens across the world. 

The one that left more questions than answers to a vast majority of people who were watching it on TV. Tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of ‚Äúglobal truthers‚Äù looking for better understanding, all in the same place working together to find out what the news media had so painfully been caught lying and concealing. I instantly fell in love with Reddit, and specifically /r/conspiracy that day when I witnessed the real-world power of what can happen with that many people focusing on the same thing so intently. 

When they had announced that they had captured the person responsible, and there was going to be a press conference at 5:00PM that day, which was subsequently cancelled after a bomb threat at the courthouse, then later denied that anyone had been captured, I deeply believe that Reddit, and the power of the hive mind collective rewrote history that day. 

They (the establishment and their mainstream media mouthpieces) had already come to a pre-determined outcome, which was completely thrown into chaos by pesky truthers. 

Over the next few days and weeks, I witnessed an unprecedented, vicious reaction by the establishment and their mainstream media mouthpieces directed at Reddit, and by extension, the millions of average every-day citizens motivated by a deep desire for Justice. ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, Vox, Daily Beast, Daily Caller, Daily Mail, Reuters, AP, The Atlantic, Media Matters, Huffington Post, BBC, Telegraph, and many others wrote hit piece after hit piece, condemning everyone for their ‚Äòmis-directed‚Äô focus away from the officially approved mainstream story.

The FBI even brazenly said at their press conference, there are a lot of photos out there floating around, and you should only consider photos and facts and evidence we provided! There were even politicians in Congressional hearings that were condemning Reddit, and the millions of people who were just trying to help that day.

Here I am thinking that what I just witnessed was the most awe inspiring, matrix breaking event in my life, and that those of us who participated in it should all be acknowledged and thanked, when entire legacy media ecosystem is screaming at me about how I‚Äôm such a bad person for looking at other evidence and coming to a different conclusion other then what the FBI provided. 

It was at this point that I TRULY understood how special of a place /r/conspiracy and Reddit can be when people come together and collectively work with each other to pursue the truth, and find answers to things together which are hidden from the mainstream narrative. 

This is why I‚Äôve dedicated so much of my time and energy focusing on building up this sub and the people here. After having my intense red-pill experience here during the Boston Bombings, I decided to completely delete my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages and only focus on Reddit. Everything I have ever wanted our sought after from social media (mostly pretty potent dopamine shots) could be found daily right here on Reddit.

The magic that occurred back then, has been replicated time and time again in this sub over the years. The power of so many people seeking the truth who are driven mostly by a deep sense of Justice, equality, morality, and a strong sense of what is right congregating daily in the same spot is incredibly intoxicating. It literally just sent shivers down my spine. With that great power also comes great responsibility. Without checks and balances, the same power that millions of truth seekers can have for good, can just as easily be used for great harm and hatred. 

It‚Äôs very important I feel to reject anyone for this position whose motivation isn‚Äôt pure, or to continue building this sub to its peak of greatness. My vision for this sub is for it to continue to be a premiere destination for the exploration and discussion of topics and subjects that go against the grain or conventional thinking. I envision a completely inclusive, hate-free sub where anyone can visit, read, and post any idea or thought, free from the thought-police and wrong-think shackles which so many of us have placed on ourselves out of fear of being different or mocked. 

I sense that /r/conspiracy will continue to see the more and more users flock here, as other social media sites continue to censor and shun entire groups of people who threaten their narrative by critically thinking things.

I do see some danger ahead when an influx of newly homeless ‚Äòwhite nationalists‚Äô who have suddenly lost their home on other platforms begin looking for a new home. It‚Äôs very possible that this sub, due to its neo-openness and neo-inclusionary policies, will surely see an uptick in overtly racist posts and comments if this happens.

I‚Äôm positive however that this sub will be able to successfully reject and repel those people who come here with bad intentions, by thoroughly rejecting all voices who advocate violence and hate.

So this human being making this communication is a subscriber of anarcho-capitalist -- the logical conclusion of libertarianism -- beliefs, also known as 'voluntarism' in more polite or volatile company (inb4brniebots bash capitalism and falsely equate it to cronyism/corporatism/the kakistocracy/Htlerian-form fascism when it was a slur coined by Mrx, who was subsidized by the Rthschlds who are the bane of humanity and declared wahr on this  country before it was created and want control of all the world's money supply with central banking fiat petrodollars quantatively-eased, to discredit the free market where polycentricity of options in credit, arbitration, defense, and this user supposes agriculture and schooling could be thrown in there as well, the artificial entity known as the 'State' is defined as coming into existence by having a monopoly over) and was just in the neighborhood of this sub when wanting to ask commenters here...

Whacha think of the Promethean (Agora/Entertainment) shows on History, gate-keepers or legit? With or without Hollyweirded added-effect to draw people in for entertainment purposes, and to what degree in yal's opinions?

Are the L a g i n a brothers (((Gewish))) and/or Templrs and/or Masons? Should they be able to recieve the treasure of Oak Island or not? What do yuh think they will do with it? This user asks this because the State is not sustainable, it continues to reach tragedy-of-the-commons/desertification in all of its functions and as Mrk Pasio talks about, only the HOWs are gone after and never the WHYs, the push-pull factors of a given conundrum, because so many are left-brain-dominant cynicism-afflicted would-be philosopher-kings or right-brain-dominant naviete-afflicted faithless slaves and that a money supply of paper fiat petrodollars which is worse than gold/silver-backed dollars, which still isn't that good, is STILL an old world way of handling transactions and the same 'people' (monstrs who think they'r descendants of alien overlords) have almost ALL the gold and silver AND created the paper system, so it's really just a transfer of money, a redistribution, of customers and capital/material between competing international and domestic monopolies, sects of Gews and/or 'tentacles' of the new world order, Rockefellr commies or Rthschild fashies, using FORCED association/diversity and FORCED disassociation/homogeneity to fight one another to keep people divided and conquered, NEITHER being the answer to the other's problems and libertarianism and voluntary association and voluntary disassociation and individualism stuck between a rock-and-a-hard-place as the common enemy.

Because lefty-greater-gucci fallacy-believers think wi're responsible for deth and racism and poverty for corporations...even though corporations wouldn't exist in AnCapistan because no government = no corporation by definition (the U.S.S.A is a Federal corporation btw, different than 'America') and righty-greater-gucci-zealots think wi'd be responsible for Muzzie raypists and Chi-coms taking over and degenerate deviancy and the like.

Roflcopter at statist-right-wingers (not real right-wingers, by definition those are anarchists, the logical conclusion of libertarians and real conservatives are libertarians, not that this user likes these as nouns to identify with as they are action-process descriptors and philosophies) and rad-leftist-minded folk alike!

It's really about options, at its core. Polycentricity. Of wont of a Polycentric Universe. Central planning does not work! Whilst there is scarcity in this world, any and all forms of distributism do.not.work! When AnCapistan's lack of IP law allows for matter pattern replicators to be made (the logical conclusion of 3D printers), and world hunger has been solved with more than just economies-of-scale (tea, ErlGray, HOT. *wrrrrrrr), and it's VOLUNTARY (subscription all teh tingz), yuh can have yr Trekkie Utopia/commune space-socialism to yr heart's content Crbyn and Brnie and co.!

Until then, leftist policies do NOT lend themselves to themselves, they only compound the problem...UNLESS ENOUGH ARE KYLLED AND BRAINWASHED ENOUGH!!! Said every dictator ever.

NO social-, let alone genetic-, engineering is required!

Debate the empirical premise and how to make things work and why they don't and things aren't feasible or ARE feasibly implemented and NOT the moral imperative....that leads to 'internet bloodsports'.

These slam-response name-n-shame YT vids by the rtards like MrkDyce and cult leaders like Sargoy and Shayro and loudmouth Crowdr who work for GlenBek who work for Faux who work for the C EYE A/CSIS and cult-ure creation programs, false-flagging demselves into the spotlight at the chagrin and detriment of low-hanging fruit and crisis actors and only appear smart because of OWNING TEH LIBTRDZZZZZ!!!!!1!1!11111! is NOT HEALTHY DISOURSE NOR IS IT SOLVING THE PROBLEMS!

A massive web of scandal and corruption is the ecosystem that brewed the Mueller scandal. It is considerably far more reaching that any news broadcast has been willing to talk about. Indeed, they are complicit and part of the same privatized intelligence machine that is a parasite upon the people of the United States. All races and all genders are affected by this deep seated corruption.

I have written and re-written multiple times in an attempt to create a piece that was relatively easy to consume, but also titanium against any shill arguments. This is where I am at, thus far:

The whole hoax could be traced [directly](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-02-14/john-brennan-mastermind-behind-russiagate) to the Deep State, including CIA and MI6.

For *years* there were people in here that absolutely refused to listen to any reason on this matter. You ignored detailed articles explaining why there was no evidence. You ignored the geopolitics of the Anglo-American regime trying to undermine Trump's attempts at detente with Russia through the hoax. 

You screamed at us. You called us brainwashed. You called us Russian puppets because we didn't want to antagonize a fellow nuclear power to the point that we all died in a nuclear holocaust. You abandoned all principles, all knowledge of the wicked history of the CIA and MI6, and pushed their genocidal propaganda on the rest of us.

This was *not* an excusable mistake. There was *no* evidence presented for this hoax. You had to *choose* to bury your head in the sand to continue believing this hysteria for over 2 years. This is a moral failing on your part. You *chose* to be a fool.

753,Another proof/test that can be done to show how Google and/or Microsoft is always listening,0,"Another proof/test that can be done to show how Google and/or Microsoft is always listeningSo there has been instances where I am sure everyone has experienced, where you would be talking to a friend or somebody,then go on the browser on your phone or computer and see an AD about something you were just talking about. No past searches or anything, just literally what you were talking about showing up online. 

Now I dont know if anyone else has experienced this but in the past few months mostly, if I am watching something on the PC and a term comes up on the TV show or movie that I am curious about so I open a tab to google what it means , before I finish what I am typing on Google, the first thing that pops up in the autocomplete suggestion box is that term I just heard and was about to just search it. 

Example, just now I am watching House and in the episode they start talking about AIP, acute intermittent porphyria, so I was not sure what that is so I open up Google and start typing ""A..C...U"" and BAM first search result is acute intermittent porphyria. This has happened constantly in the past few months alone. I have even tested it by watching an episode of The Office and when Dwight asked Creed if he knew what was on the picture he was showing  (Marijuana) , Creed responded Northern Lights cannabis indica. I went to Google exactly that and before I finished typing Northern, Google's auto search suggestion had Northern Lights Cannabis Indica as the second choice on the list. I was going to post a screenshot as an example but I dont think clearing history mattered and itll show up as a past search due to Google's learning algorithm. 

So what I am assuming is happening is the browser is listening constantly  (or maybe its Microsoft because Windows 10 has voice search option available, or both who knows anymore), and the last few words heard it recognizes and when you start typing in the search bar it suggests it.  I dont think its too far-fetched to imagine the possibility of that happening, just amazes me that we , or at least speaking for myself , are close to being numb about it that it doesnt realy change anything anymore. Would like to hear (read) anyone else's opinion or thoughts of this actually being possible and your experiences if you noticed this or something else weird happening like that. Makes you imagine what else could be next.

Here is some scientifically-backed research that dispels the idea that vaccines are as vital as the CDC makes them out to be.


Regarding Measles:

- The mortality rate of Measles had declined by almost 100% **before the vaccine was even introduced** in 1968*

[Here is the chart](http://healthimpactnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/G11.4-UK-Measles-1838-1978.png) that showcases the Measles mortality rate between the years 1838-1978. 


So how and why did the Measles death rate steadily decline without the introduction of vaccines?

**Factors such as hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, labor laws, electricity, chlorination, refrigeration, pasteurization, and many other facets that we now generally take for granted as part of modern life were all introduced/improved.**

Nutrition is key:

Discovered in the 1920s, vitamin A was dubbed the ‚Äúanti-infective‚Äù vitamin. It alone has had a tremendous impact on measles deaths. During the 1990s, mortality reductions of 60 to 90 percent were measured in poor countries using vitamin A in hospitalized measles cases.

&gt; Combined analyses showed that massive doses of vitamin A given to patients hospitalized with measles were associated with an approximately 60% reduction in the risk of death overall, and with **an approximate 90% reduction among infants** . . . Administration of vitamin A to children who developed pneumonia before or during hospital stay reduced mortality by about 70% compared with control children. [1]

The availability of vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables was another factor responsible for the steep mortality reduction. There were improving trends in overall nutrition, as seen by a parallel in the decline in deaths from measles and the vitamin C deficiency disease, scurvy. Experiments done in the 1940s showed that vitamin C was effective against measles, especially when used in higher doses.

&gt; During an epidemic [of measles] vitamin C was used prophylactically and all those who received as much as 1000 mg. every six hours, by vein or muscle, were protected from the virus. Given by mouth, 1000 mg. in fruit juice every two hours was not protective unless it was given around the clock. It was further found that 1000 mg. by mouth, four to six times each day, would modify the attack; with the appearance of Koplik‚Äôs spots and fever, if the administration was increased to 12 doses each 24 hours, **all signs and symptoms would disappear in 48 hours.** [2]


Vaccines playing a miniscule role in the eradication of infectious diseases:


In 1977, a report was published that credited vaccines with, at best, approximately 3% of the mortality decline from infectious diseases.

&gt; In general, medical measures (both chemotherapeutic and prophylactic) appear to have contributed little to the overall decline in mortality in the United States since about 1900‚Äîhaving in many instances been introduced several decades after a marked decline had already set in and having no detectable influence in most instances. More specifically, with reference to those five conditions (influenza, pneumonia, diphtheria, whooping cough, and poliomyelitis) for which the decline in mortality appears substantial after the point of intervention‚Äîand on the unlikely assumption that all of this decline is attributable to the intervention . . . **it is estimated that at most 3.5 percent of the total decline in mortality since 1900 could be ascribed to medical measures introduced for the diseases** considered here. [3]


Regarding Whooping Cough and other infectious diseases:

In 1979, Sweden withdrew use of the DTP vaccine on the basis that it was not effective and possibly unsafe. They feared that with lower vaccination rates, the death rate would increase. 

In 1995, sixteen (16) years later, Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control indicated that deaths from whooping cough **remained near zero.**

&gt;  Sweden‚Äôs population was 8,294,000 in 1979 and 8,831,000 by 1995. From 1981 to 1993, eight children were recorded as dying, with the cause of death listed as pertussis. This averaged to be about 0.6 children per year possibly dying from whooping cough. These numbers show that the odds of dying from pertussis in Sweden were about 1 in 13,000,000 **even when there was no national vaccination program.** [4]

In the case of Scarlet fever disease, deaths declined to near zero **without any widespread vaccination.**


Vaccines acting as a danger to society:

**The measles vaccine does not create lifelong immunity, whereas natural infection with measles does.** 

The only way to remain immune with artificial immunity via vaccines is to be vaccinated several times during a lifetime. 

A 1984 study reported that:

&gt;By 2050, the proportion of measles susceptibles **may be greater than in the pre-vaccine era.** [5]

A 2009 study investigated what could happen with waning measles vaccine immunity even with high vaccine coverage among children.

&gt; We can foresee that vaccination will have two conflicting effects . . . it will reduce the number of newborn susceptibles and hence should have some of the usual associated public-health benefits reducing the number of cases in young children. However, **this reduction in cases will lead to a reduction in boosting and therefore a greater susceptibility to infection in older age classes** . . . When immunity wanes, vaccination has a far more limited impact on the average number of cases. While this observation has clear public-health implications, the dynamic consequences of the interaction between vaccination, waning immunity and boosting are far more striking. **For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced.** [6]


I'm going to share that last sentence again separately:

**For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced.**
















*Upon further research, 1968 is technically the second Measles vaccine. The original vaccine, originally introduced in 1963 was completely abandoned due to causing:

&gt; pneumonia as well as encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain)."" [7]

The vaccine also 

&gt; produced a ‚Äúmodified measles‚Äù rash in about half of those injected‚Äîessentially equivalent to a case of measles. Forty-eight percent of people had a rash, and 83 percent had fevers up to 106¬∞F post-injection. [8]


For those who try to claim the decline showcased in the first chart was due to the 1963 vaccine, think again. A 1989 Report was published that claimed:

&gt; the 1963 vaccine was ‚Äúnot widely effective‚Äù and that the 1967 vaccine was unsta¬¨ble and lost its ‚Äúeffectiveness‚Äù if not properly refrigerated. **It was not until 1980** that a stable live measles vaccine became available. [9]

so they just not do their research? Do they not know about his many failed predictions starting from the very moment he first started posting?

is it that the majority of his fans get their information from cherry-picked posts in YouTube videos?

that's my theory. There's a lot of his fans are just people who heard about him through YouTube and didn't actually do any research it to him or read his posts

they probably don't even know when he started posting or what website he was using

And if it was really real and they truly believed it was real they wouldn't spend so much time trying to desperately prove that it was real

his proofs I'm out to he occasionally uses a word that Trump sometimes uses. Or maybe his tweet sounds somewhat similar to a different tweet that Trump made

but that's what the intelligence officials  spending all their time doing then it's pretty pathetic

I'm pretty sure most of the people following him weren't following him at the beginning. The people that were following him at the beginning gave up

but I'm pretty sure the people that continue to follow him  dontt do their research. They her some references to him in YouTube videos and assume he must be re

I mean nothing about it even makes sense. And none of his predictions came true. Except that he posted a plus sign and Trump are sometimes posted plus sign

The incident had to do with the anti-anti-vax MEMES. After the viral spread of those, there have been many reports of anit-vax teenagers getting vaccinated.

In sense of the anti-vaxxers this may be good (just my opinion), but I am afraid, that this technique could be used in a very bad way, by some goverments, cooperations etc.

783,Am I a psychic or something? Something weird is going on.,0,"Am I a psychic or something? Something weird is going on.So, ever since last year I noticed that I had the ability to predict things with a 90% accuracy. The first thing I predicted was the outcome of the South Carolina Gamecocks vs the Ole Miss Rebels Football game that happened last year. I predicted that the Gamecocks were going to win that game before the 3rd or 4th quarter began. They were losing at first, and the Gamecocks really do suck as a team (as i've heard from other people who watch Football), but somehow I was able to predict that they were going to catch up at the end of the game and beat the Rebels, which doesn't usually happen. Then I also made a future prediction that the Gamecocks were going to lose the next game against the Florida Gators (which also came true).

Here are the links to the games that happened late last year (note that while I was trying to remember the name of the first team that they beat before their match with the gators, I had guessed that it was Mississippi, but I didn't think it was Mississippi state that they went up against. ""Ole Miss"" popped up into my head, so I looked for Mississippi, and sure enough, that was the exact game that I was thinking about.)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\_South\_Carolina\_Gamecocks\_football\_team#at\_Ole\_Miss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football_team#at_Ole_Miss)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\_South\_Carolina\_Gamecocks\_football\_team#at\_Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football_team#at_Florida)

I've probably predicted far more things as well. But for the sake of brevity, i'm going to make this as short and sweet as I can. A few days ago, I was looking for the Amazing Atheists' video on Trayvon Martin (and btw, this happened years ago, and I don't remember what reignited my interest in this topic or what I wanted to know TJ's stance on it was for), and ""Justice for Trayvon"" had popped up into my head from out of nowhere, and I shit you not, that was the exact name of the video that TJ had uploaded. And btw, I haven't watched his videos in years.

Another thing is I can get sort of a detection that something bad is going to happen or happened. Not anything specific like world events, but I can just get a feeling that something isn't right. Like today when it was early in the morning and the news was on, I remember how the weather forecaster talked about how beautiful and shiny the sun is going to be today, and I remembered 9/11 and how peacefully that day started off, and I got a little bit freaked out. I was thinking that it may have been one of those ""all is calm before the storm"" moments. But nothing has happened on an international scale or anything significant personally (at least not as of yet).

I also started to remember weird things from my childhood as well as some weird trivial stuff that I haven't thought about in years (and I mean in over a decade now). Like for example, there was this Pokemon spin-off, kinda like Yu-Gi-Oh or Beyblade, but literally forgot what it was called until I somehow thought ""Duel Masters."" I don't know how the fuck I remembered that. Then I remembered that time this black kid had visited my house when I was a kid and wondered if he was the same kid who went to my elementary and middle school and still know on FaceBook. I might have to ask my grandmother about that. Then there was another WEIRD memory I had when I was with my grandmother (father's mother), and had put a hairband around my arm, and it felt really comfortable and good, and she kept trying to take it off, but then suddenly this white shit started oozing out. I then remembered this story about this woman who was having orgasms of her feet (footgasms, basically), and I remembered the strange concept of having orgasms with other parts of your body that aren't generally considered ""erogenous zones.""

As for other things I thought up, as for moving out of my mom/grandparents house and finding independence, I started getting these outside-of-the-box ideas that I had never thought of before. Like getting into contact with my mom's ex-friend and seeing if I can start dating her and if she would approve with helping me straighten my life out (although I would probably have to do it behind her back somehow), then I got another idea which I never thought of before, and that would be to call my mom's sister (an aunt to me; my mom HATES her, and she has done more damage to her than anybody) and tell her everything about my mom and see what she could do about it, but even if she couldn't get me out and have enough room to move me in, to at least ruin my mom some more. And then the last option if all the other options failed would be to try and apply for a drivers permit/license and getting a car (if they would let me do that). Because I remembered that just about every single failure in my life was entirely my mom's doing and not my own, EXCEPT for the driving part. I never bothered to read the manual because i'm too lazy for that, so instead if I really dedicated myself to it, and if they will let this work out for me, I could start reading that manual, taking driving lessons, etc. so that way I won't need to rely entirely on them for transportation, and I could rely on myself for that to get anywhere (like to a job, for example), and I would already be somewhat independent if I had my own car, even if I lived under their roof still. I also got a whole bunch of other ideas, but I won't go into them here.

As for the last thing that I can remember right now, was when I went on the 4plebs archive to look for some specific 4chan posts to see if I could find a specific fight video I saw a few years ago, but noticed that every time I clicked on the search bar, it would pop up and disappear. Every time I tried to click on it, it would do this. I got frustrated and asked somewhere online, but before anyone was able to answer, I got the idea of using a different browser and trying it to see if it will work. So, I then opened up Internet Explorer, tried it again, and it worked this time. Note that I have zero technical skills. I don't know how to script, code, or pretty much do anything like that. I just figured this out on my own somehow. There's plenty more examples that I can remember, but the for the sake of brevity am not including here, and some that I probably forgot.

Does anyone know an explanation for this? This has been happening since at least November 2018, and I don't think it's God, because i'm not really a follower of Christianity. What exactly could this be? Could it all just be a coincidence? That's possible, but very unlikely given how accurate these predictions are and how many times I got things right. Some things I haven't heard of in years and have completely escaped from my memory and don't know anymore are somehow popping up. Like the Duel Masters thing for example. The last time I watched that show was sometime back in the early 2000s, when I was a small child. I remembered having an action figure of the main character in the bath tub, and for some reason I remembered that as well as what it was from.

I believe all 3 were faked in order to reduce the amount of people willing to call out the NZ hoax.  ""have some decency.  Two girls just killed themselves bc they went through something so traumatic and people like you call it fake.""

The 3 hoaxers are just fabricated identies. A fake name with a fake background commited fake suicide. Keeps the hoaxes alive, and it supplies the shills with emotion to appeal to.

Now my actual reason for this post is a little bit Meta, so I apologize if i break rule two. Hopefully a mod can let me know if my next point is ban worthy and I'll remove post but:

I think this sub's users should consider stopping the use of the ""he'll be suicided soon"" trope.  This is often used here when a person may know too much about something. R conspiracy users post this trope at least once every post regurading anything even slightly important.. Hoax events, child trafficking, 911 etc

I think we should consider making an effort to reduce the frequency of this trope for a couple reasons. 

1) Do not normalize murder.  

2) Do not intimidate people into self-censorship. 

3) Do not promote violence.

So many people are claiming that the Sandy Hook father was ""suicided"" bc he was going to go public with the hoax.  In my opinion, many of the commenter that are posting this theory are doing so disingenuously as an intimidation tactic.  We know the deep state fakes deaths constantly, so why would this death be any different? To me, it's obvious that neither girl nor father actually killed themselves and no, neither of them were murdered by the goverment. If the government killed them to keep them silent, why plaster their stories all over the internet? If father was going to talk and you wanted to kill him, you could do it and not mention it.

Anyway, i know that not all commenters who perpetuate the ""suicided"" trope are doing so maliciously, but some are. Please consider my message. That is all.

It's important to note, from the Gentleperson's Guide to Forum Spies, that these tactics only work *if people are not aware of them*. That's why shills get the most angry when you deconstruct their shilling and [logical fallacies](http://themillenniumreport.com/2017/07/internet-trolls-and-shills-experts-in-the-use-of-logical-fallacies/), because it deprives them of all their power and threatens their control over other users.

An important part of the shill ego is their belief that they are honest, and they are ""correcting the record"" by dishonest people. By refuting their dishonest tactics, you show them that they are actually not honest people, they are professional liars who have sold their soul. When they realize this, most become extremely demoralized, stop trying very hard, or quit and find gainful employment. Thus, it is actually a kind, virtuous act to confront a shill on their dishonest tactics, because it will lead to them earning more money, not having to lie for a living, and becoming honest, happy people.

Don't assume that ""everyone knows about the shills."" They don't. We get hundreds of new subscribers *per day.*

Don't repeat the claim ""don't feed the trolls."" That is bad advice. Countering propaganda requires that you [refute it in a timely manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpropaganda#Employed_rapidly), before it can affect perceptions.

One of the best ways to tell someone's motivation is by observing how they respond to people who expose shills and their methods. The normal profile of a person who comes to a board to discuss conspiracies is that they hate propaganda and want honest discussion. So, it's very much out-of-place when you see someone defending shills, minimizing their harm, or (most telling) attacking anyone who talks about shills.

A few of these people are totally new and/or have terrible discernment. The rest are either paid shills, or unpaid trolls like Top Losers, who sit in their parents' basements and, like the angry children they are, do everything they can to disrupt the grown-ups while we are having a conversation.

If you are one of the small group of people who are not shills or trolls but attack people who talk about them, stop it. You are literally acting as an agent of the people you are trying to expose and stop.

If you are a paid shill, remember that you are impotent hobgoblins on the wrong side of history. You have no power to influence discussions like the ones we have here, because we know all of your plans. You are selling your soul to the devil for a few bucks an hour. You would be much happier and wealthier if you got minimum wage at McDonald's, producing an actual good that has economic value and might brighten someone's day a little bit. With your extra money and self esteem, you might be able to go to junior college or trade school, and really get your life headed in a better direction.

Or, you can live with the bone-crushing shame and possible [jail time](http://progressivearmy.com/2016/10/08/exposed-clinton-campaign-violated-campaign-finance-laws/) that will come when this whole thing comes crashing down, and everyone you know realizes that you were supporting things like the Military-Industrial Complex, elite pedophilia, and mass genocide.

800,"I saw this on Facebook, Mueller's ties to Clinton Foundation exposed. What do you think?",0,"I saw this on Facebook, Mueller's ties to Clinton Foundation exposed. What do you think?This is a bit long, but here we go....

  

He would have to bring down himself and all his people!  
 

From 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation.  
 

A Grand Jury had been empaneled.  
 

Governments from around the world had donated to the ‚ÄúCharity‚Äù.  
 

Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those ‚ÄúDonations‚Äù to the Clinton Foundation were declared.  
 

Hmmm, now you would think that an honest investigator would be able to figure this out.  
 

Guess who took over this investigation in 2002?  
 

Bet you can‚Äôt guess.  
 

No other than James ‚ÄúWassup Homey‚Äù Comey.  
 

Now, that‚Äôs interesting, isn‚Äôt it?  
 

Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS?  
 

Your friend and mine, our favorite person in the whole world if you are a Tea Party Member, Pro-Life or a True the Vote supporter‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. ding, ding, ding, ding Lois ‚ÄúBe on The Look Out‚Äù (BOLO) Lerner.  
 

Now, that‚Äôs interesting, isn‚Äôt it?  
 

It gets better, well not really, but I am sure this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right?  
 

Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?  
 

No other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.  
 

Now, that‚Äôs interesting, isn‚Äôt it?  
 

Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this timeframe???  
 

I know, it‚Äôs a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, Robert Mueller.  
 

What do all four casting characters have in common?  
 

They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.  
 

Now that‚Äôs just a coincidence, right?  
 

Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance.  
 

Let‚Äôs fast forward to 2009, shall we?  
 

James ‚ÄúWassup Homey‚Äù Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.  
 

Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.  
 

The Uranium One ‚Äúissue‚Äù comes to the attention of the Hildabeast.  
 

Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America‚Äôs best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to no other than, the Russians.  
 

Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn‚Äôt, the People got absolutely nothing out of it.  
 

However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Arkansas Bill goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.  
 

Ok, no big deal right?  
 

Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.  
 

Guess who was the FBI Director during this timeframe?  
 

Yep, Robert Mueller.  
 

He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.  
 

Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney‚Äôs Office in Maryland.  
 

No other than, Rod Rosenstein.  
 

Guess what happened to the informant?  
 

The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.  
 

Interesting, huh?  
 

How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?  
 

Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved?  
 

\~145 million dollars in ‚Äúdonations‚Äù made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.  
 

Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?  
 

No other than, Lois ‚ÄúBOLO‚Äù Lerner.  
 

Interesting, huh?  
 

Ok, that‚Äôs all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?  
 

Let‚Äôs fast forward to 2015.  
 

Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 ‚Äúinvestigations‚Äù the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that the Hildabeast ran the State Department on a unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.  
 

He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her ‚ÄúPublic Service‚Äù as Secretary of State which was required by law.  
 

He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email.  
 

I will spare you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they did everything humanly possible to cover for the Hildabeast.  
 

Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?  
 

Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer.  
 

No other than James ‚ÄúWassup Homey‚Äù Comey.  
 

Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh?  
 

Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the ‚ÄúClinton Email Investigation‚Äù after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner ‚ÄúMatter‚Äù at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her.  
 

Nope couldn‚Äôt find any crimes there.  
 

Can you guess what happened next?  
 

In April 2016, James ‚ÄúWassup Homey‚Äù Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.  
 

They didn‚Äôt even convene a Grand Jury.  
 

Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true ‚ÄúGangsta‚Äù Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates the Hildabeast from any wrongdoing.  
 

Can you see the pattern?  
 

I could go on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.  
 

FISA Abuse, political espionage..... pick a crime, any crime, chances are...... this group and a few others did it.  
 

All the same players.  
 

All compromised and conflicted.  
 

All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.  
 

All connected in one way or another to the Clinton's.

Think these middle-eastern conflicts are proxy wahrs between Enkee and Enlyl proxies wanting either knowledge or ignorance for humanity or some portion of it?

Think it's about star-gate machines being held in secret or spears of destiny-like objects?

Is it really just about an oil pipeline to compete with/screw over another pipeline between Trky and Rushya and Syrya and a prelude to a Greatr Izzyehl Project for Zios vs. Eyeran?

If so, eye as an anarchist take no such sides because of the 'lesser of the two evls' and all of that jazz, but eye'd be remiss if eye didn't posit that Eyeran, Rushya, and Syrya pale in comparison to crimes committed by the Izzyhel, U.S.S.A, Sowdi Arabya axis of evl alliance.

Think it's because Putn, while a dbag, kicked out the Lciferians and Muzzies saved stuff from the Library of Alexndria and people don't want these locks and keys to exist OR want to combine them for their own use and that's why wi have so many conflicts today also the State is unsustainable and anarchy/polycentricity in credit, arbitration, and defense, is the answer.

There's a conspiracy from some quantum researcher that there's an 'Organization' against or for some 'luminati that like the Drkness of forces in 'D e s t i n y' the game, are making their last stand on Earth and its located underneath the sewers and tunnels of N Y C?

This may explain why plans to Truhmp tower were stolen years ago, to try and find it and there may be no tech in the old timer's office there, to prevent spying.

Also, think Barro Truhmp is a time-traveler and/or Stev Banon? Also, think this dood may be in communication with J-Rod the alien Gray from the future and setting up some kinda deal for or against a future catastrophe humans evolve into bugs underground after?

Think this is behind JadHelm/Rehx84 and the widening of highways and militarizing jackbooted thugs, to kidnap people and toss em underground in concentration camp cities while husbands are away fyting WW3 in the Ukrayn, NK, and Vnezuela for NO DAM GOOD REASON!?!?!?

Any1 else think there's an Arkhm Aslyuhm beneath Cedr Snai hospital out west in Cali where these celebrities all are rushed to like Sheehn, Britny, and Kahnye, and Kahnye being told 'es off iz meds again and SNL appearance were punishment for going off-script, off the Democrip plantation? 440hz mind control perhaps?

821,"""The Cube"" in More Media and the Collective Unconscious",0,"""The Cube"" in More Media and the Collective UnconsciousThe Cube. Why does this damn thing keep showing up?

[ \\""All art intuitively apprehends coming changes in the collective unconsciousness.\\"" - C.G. Jung ](https://i.redd.it/cjgt1jnwcpo21.png)

In *The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature* (1967), Carl Jung states that ‚Äúthe artist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks his own ends, but one who allows art to realize its purposes through him.‚Äù He goes on to say that the artist is ‚Äúone who carries and shapes the unconscious, psychic life of mankind.‚Äù He tells us that this force is ‚Äúa force of nature that achieves its end either with tyrannical might or with the subtle cunning of nature herself, quite regardless of the personal fate of the man who is its vehicle‚Äù. Jung enforces the ‚Äòtortured artist‚Äô motif, the idea that the artist is someone who must create, even if it means sacrificing their own well-being.

The famous psychiatrist portrays the artist as a messenger for mankind, someone who sometimes acts as a vessel for a divine force. Art is then looked at as the way the collective unconscious‚Äô communicates with the humanity. According to its definition, art is ‚Äúthe expression or application of human creative skill and imagination‚Äù. By virtue, this makes film and even videogames the most popular art form of our technological age. We could then safely say someone like Stanley Kubrick was a great artist of our time and modern day myth maker. Rather than reading epics on stone tablets or parchments, we now watch them on screens. But what are the modern day myths trying to tell us?

In the picture above I have compiled a collection of movies, video games, sculptures and a few other forms of art that are telling a story about a cube (or in the case of sculptures, presenting the symbol). From right to left, up to down, are: *Cube*(1997), *Fortnite* (2017), *Hellraiser* (1987), *Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubicus)* (1954), *Star Trek* (1966), *An Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and Its Kindred Sciences* (1894), *Transformers* (1984), *2036 Origin Unknown* (2018), *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), *Subnautica* (2018), *The Avengers* (2012), *The Cube ""Endover""* (1968), pages from Leonardo Da Vinci‚Äôs notebook describing Metatron‚Äôs Cube, *La T√™te au Carr√©* (2002), and *Action Comics #263* (1960). Within these stories, the cube‚Äôs role differs, but there are consistent themes. The cube is typically seen as something powerful and otherworldly. Sometimes it is seen as ancient. Other times it seems to symbolize the material world as a whole. Its also often referred to as a tesseract, or a four dimensional cube, the fourth dimension being time.

Another theme that echoes throughout these stories is the cube‚Äôs association with the planet Saturn. This is fitting because in Roman and Greek mythology, Saturn is the god of time. Jungian psychology correlates Saturn with the Shadow and equates it as a planetary archetype to senex, or the wise old man. In his negative form he appears as the devouring father, Kronos. Jung struggled against this archetype later in life. This was one of driving forces behind his seclusion that produced The Red Book. Jung was fascinated by astrology claiming that it ‚Äúrepresents the sum of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity‚Äù. He liked to wrestle with the question of how such synchronicity occurs between terrestrial events and astrological constellations. Do the planets, namely Saturn, chief of them all, have some sort influence on the world?

Anyways, one artistic masterpiece I'd like to focus on is Subnautica.

""Subnautica is an open world survival adventure video game developed and published by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. It allows the player to freely explore the ocean on an alien planet, known as planet 4546B, collecting unique resources to survive.""

First of all this game is amazing. The scenery is beautiful, the creatures are awesome, the story is cool - I love it. If you have't played it you should (also spoiler alert). But one thing I found really interesting is the symbolism towards the end of the game. There‚Äôs a temple at the bottom of the ocean with a powerful artificially intelligent cube inside. It's ancient and its from aliens. Sound familiar?

[The picture says it all](https://i.redd.it/y1jjwjl5cpo21.png)

Also inside the temple is a Lovecraftian-like being. If you've read my previous posts you know I've talked about inter-dimensional aliens more likely being squid-like rather than reptilian-like. Perhaps H.P. Lovecraft was channeling some truth into his writings. That could possibly be why they resonated with the collective unconscious and became so popular. We could say the temple is reminiscent of R'lyeh.

[Sea Emperor Leviathan](https://i.redd.it/8oh8g5oacpo21.png)

Perhaps this being and the cube are a nod to the shapeshifters from Saturn? We could also say that the powers at be are shapeshifters in a another sense other than literal. This term could be a manifestation of how we feel about the two faced-ness of the politicians who take part in the Saturnian control system. I‚Äôve also theorized that many tentacled monsters could subconsciously represent the madness the intellect experiences as one tries to go deeper within and approaches the void. The Kraken protects the void because within the void is where true peace and power lie. This is the hidden treasure at the bottom of the One Mind‚Äôs ocean.

[Zen, the Void](https://i.redd.it/wgbe6mvecpo21.png)

But still the question lingers, what does this all mean? Is the collective unconscious trying to tell us something about the matrix-like nature of reality?

Jung never spoke about the symbolism of the cube (he realized the significance of the Nature of Four nevertheless), however, he did have a cube of his own that was very important to him. One day, the Swiss doctor ordered some stones for an enclosing wall he was building. He wanted to build one around his garden at his second home, the Bollingen Tower. But when masons from the local quarry showed up, they accidentally brought the wrong cornerstone. Rather than the triangle piece Jung originally ordered, they brought what he called ‚Äúa perfect cube‚Äù. One mason was furious and tried to return it immediately but Jung exclaimed ‚ÄúNo, that is my stone, I must have it!‚Äù For some reason that he could not explain, he was drawn to it. He decided to chisel phrases and symbols onto its sides. Ironically, the front side is etched with a passage about time.

825,"Could Falun Gong be planning a coup against the Chinese Communist government, and using Shen Yun to raise funds and support for this cause?",0,"Could Falun Gong be planning a coup against the Chinese Communist government, and using Shen Yun to raise funds and support for this cause?I'll have to find sources for this, but it's my understanding that China has a long history of politically subversive movements hiding in plain sight as new religious movements. This phenomenon is by no means unique to China, but it's precedented enough there that dynasties have fallen at the hands of radical sects. As a result most Chinese leaders have learned to be preemptively mistrustful and suppressive of any non-state-sanctioned new religious movement that gains widespread popularity. I should note here that China has long had a spiritual concept called the Mandate of Heaven, whereby it is the people's *moral duty* to rise up against and overthrow a corrupt leader.

Shen Yun, a traditional Chinese dance troupe founded in New York City, is owned and operated by Falun Gong, a highly popular and radical sect of the indigenous Chinese religion whose persecution by the Chinese Communist Party has received international attention. The stated aim of Shen Yun is to preserve and promulgate traditional Chinese forms of entertainment that are deprecated by the CCP. I have never seen Shen Yun, but I am struck by how large and inescapable their advertising campaign has been here in the northeastern US. Falun Gong obviously has deep pockets, and is obviously making a lot of money on these highly popular performances. I've spoken to people who've seen the performance, and it seems to be achieving its aim of increasing Americans' appreciation for traditional Chinese culture.

It wouldn't surprise me if the leaders of Falun Gong were playing a long game of infiltrating and undermining the CCP. A part of this could involve the projection of soft power in the West, by creating a populace sympathetic to Falun Gong's self-described stewardship of real Chinese culture, such that when the ax is dropped, much of the world thinks the change is for the good.

Choice 2: He can prepare food for prisoners.  Regardless of how many prisoners get ill, Bob keeps all of his money because the prisoners are taken care of under a different program.

His choices are between making a product for which he could be held accountable and making a product for which he will not be held accountable.  

**This is the simple answer as to why the childhood vaccination schedule advocated by the CDC has ballooned to ridiculous proportions**.



In 1986 Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), creating a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits.  

Vaccine makers have a choice. They can make vaccines for everyone and face liability if their product damages or kills someone.

OR

They can manufacture and pioneer invention **in childhood vaccines, specifically, which inherently holds no risk of liability**.

This is the only reason the CDC says kids ""need"" the insane number of shots these days.  The suppliers are manufacturing demand in a population held hostage.  Bob would far rather make food for prisoners, when given the choice. Financially, it is the safest way to go.

863,Reality is simulated and humans are just 'lab rats',0,"Reality is simulated and humans are just 'lab rats'Personally I believe in this theory for 101%. There is just too much to explain. I myself have been learning programming for about 7/8 years. I am able to write my own A.I. (simple one but still :) ). Also I have a pretty good understanding of biology and physics. When you compare the way A.I. and other technology works with the way our universe works, it is almost exactly the same!

Take a look at Darwin's Theory of evolution. Living  organisms evolve very slowly, generation by generation and after a long time, flaws slowly get 'patched'. A neutral network works the same.
Let's say we have an A.I. that is made to complete a Super Mario Bros level flawlessly. It starts with knowing nothing. First it tries something, let's say walk forward and it fails, then based on the results of it's previous move results, it makes another move. It does this till until it can complete the level perfectly. By the time it has done this it will be on about the 30th 40th generation depending on the complexity of the level. If you want you can watch this video about an A.I. learning to play Mario: https://youtu.be/qv6UVOQ0F44

If you look at let's say the human body. It works almost exactly the same as a computer. You have a processor (your brain), you have short term memory (RAM), long term memory (ROM) etc.. Your brain has neurons in it interacting with each other. They do this by sending light signals (explained very quickly) back and forth. This is exactly the same as optical fiber. If a neuron fires light, it's a 1, if it does not fire, it's a 0. This is also how binary works.
Also your immune system is just amazing!! You really need to watch this video about it!!: https://youtu.be/zQGOcOUBi6s
Everything is just so perfect every single time that it has to be some kind of algorithm.
And the immune system isn't the only algorithmic aspect of life. For example you have the Fibonacci sequence. A actual algorithm that you can see everywhere! And a lot more! Video about it: https://youtu.be/wTlw7fNcO-0

The smartest A.I. that exists is a Japanese robot. It is about as smart as a cockroach. But in a few years, especially with the future help of the quantum computer we will create an A.I. that is as smart as a human. This is called the singularity and is estimated to take place in 2043. And the thing with A.I. (and most animals including humans) is that the smarter it becomes, the father it learns. This creates an infinite loop in which it will learn faster and faster until it will turn into some all knowing higher being.
We would be able to literally simulate consciousness inside of a being that is smarter then the human species will ever get. We are already capable of simulating the big bang. So if we will be able to do that in a couple of years, what is the chance that some other advanced civilization didn't already do this and we are their A.I.?
Elon Musk actually answered this question and the answer is: The chance that we are NOT simulated is one in BILLIONS. The chances we are simulated are actually way bigger then the chance we aren't.

Think of it like this. We humans use other dumber animals for experiments. To test medicine and such. We look at rats and monkeys to learn from they behaviour.
What if we are just a bunch of lab rats. What if the advanced civilization that simulated us did so because they wanted to see how we evolve, how we revolutionize and what we invent so they can learn and benefit from it.

The Unthinkable

In early October 2001, when anthrax scares and letters were at their height, the media frequently employed the word ""unthinkable"" to describe an anthrax or bioweapons attack by an enemy. MacQueen cites seven influential outlets (e.g., NYT, CNN, USA Today) among many. Who pushed the media into peddling this meme? MacQueen doesn't say, but he concludes "". . . there is a pattern here.""¬†He says it might not be a conspiracy, "". . . but whatever the origins of the 'unthinkable' discourse, it deserves investigation and contemplation"" which he proceeds to do.

For many years before 2001, ""the unthinkable"" had been used as a term among those who studied and participated in American war strategy to refer to nuclear war, traced to Herman Kahn's famous book,¬†Thinking about the Unthinkable. Kahn gave the term a quasi-technical status which was accepted by many subsequent writers. How did ""unthinkable"" as a term for nuclear weapons get morphed into a term for bioweapons in 2001?

In 1972, the U.S. and Soviet Union signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), a pillar of the Cold War strategy of nuclear deterrence. The superpowers agreed to renounce the attempt to build weapons of defense against nuclear missiles. They gave up military defense on the understanding that the prospect of nuclear retaliation by the enemy was so horrifying that each side would be deterred from attacking the other. MacQueen writes, ""This was an unusual agreement in the history of warfare and came about due to the spectacular destructiveness of nuclear weapons and the fact that no technology had been invented to offer a significant defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles.""

On May 1, 2001, President Bush gave a major foreign policy speech at Ft. McNair putting the public on notice that the U.S. intended to unilaterally withdraw from the ABM Treaty. A signatory could withdraw as long as they gave six months notice and was able to cite ""extraordinary events"" that have ""jeopardized its supreme interests."" Bush put the proposed withdrawal in terms of good (us) versus evil (Soviets), and that since the evil Soviet Union no longer existed and Russia was democratic, cuts in nuclear arsenals were thus possible. In other words, he invokes everyone to leave behind the relics of the Cold War era such as the ABM Treaty. How clever and convenient, right?

Bush then explained that there were new dangers at hand ‚Äì ""weapons of mass destruction"" ‚Äì a phrase which at that time referred only to nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and biological weapons. These weapons were in the hands of ""some of the world's least responsible states."" When Bush spoke of making a shift to ""a new framework,"" Bush said the U.S. must be willing to ""rethink the unthinkable."" The expression had not been used on a comparably important occasion. In this context, it meant be aware of 1) terrorism and 2) rogue states with WMDs, both events which would shortly come to pass (i.e., the 9/11 attack, followed by the anthrax attacks). Either George Bush has incredible prescience, or foreknowledge was at work.

The ""new framework"" had actually already been expressed in a PNAC document in 2000 whose members had been trying for years to invade and take over Iraq and establish a Pax Americana. One of the key recommendations of the PNAC document is to create a defense capability to enable a policy of aggression, or threat of same, by eliminating the target entity's ability to launch a retaliation.

In other words, the U.S. needed to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. The Bush White House used the pretext of the 9/11 attack to withdraw from the ABM Treaty on December 13, 2001. MacQueen argues (with references) that the withdrawal was ""a top-down decision made by a small number of men engaging in minimal consultation with others inside the U.S. security community.""

The problem is that although the 9/11 attacks were horrific, they had little to do with the ABM Treaty, as there was no nuclear weapons involved and not even a ""weapons of mass destruction."" By December 13, the White House had dropped the claim that al Qaeda and/or Iraq were responsible for the anthrax attacks since by then it was well-established to be a domestic operation. So there was no ""extraordinary event"" to permit a withdrawal from the ABM Treaty based on the treaty's tenets.

885,Prospiracy. What a concept.,0,"Prospiracy. What a concept.prospiracy
(pro-SPEAR-uh-see) A secret plan by a group of people to do something good for another person or group of people. The opposite of a conspiracy.

At a low point while delving into the conspiracy realm I decided to actively search out those who are doing the opposite of all the examples and possibilities of nefarious and uncaring actions many of us have become acquainted with here and in other platforms.

I found an incredible wealth of initiatives and actions that many good folks are doing not only in resistance to greedy and at times psychopathic machinations of ""progress"" but solely for the sense and propulsion of acts of kindness and concern for well being. If these examples were what was the focus of the narrative we are awash with I think our experience could be quite different.

Two decades ago I was of the belief that the system, our elected officials, and masters of industry were enacting initiatives for enhancing our shared experience. Whether I am now more awake to reality or have taken on a pessimistic perspective, I find it a challenge to find incidences of the ""deciders"" protecting rights and privacy, improving water and food quality, mirroring and expecting ethics and justice, making education better, curbing spending, promoting health, etc.

After this shift I began to look for leaked emails, FOIA requests, laws, and initiatives by those SWORN to represent the needs and rights of citizens that would be Prospiracies. Rights seem to be vanishing, inequality expanding, regulations favouring the haves, all need based costs rising while wages are stagnant, etc‚Ä¶

902,"History of the term ""Indian subcontinent""",1,"History of the term ""Indian subcontinent""There is a trending question on r/explainlikeimfive about why the Indian subcontinent has that name. There are takes such as how the Himalayas were impossible to navigate and the only way to India was via sea. To me, that seems incorrect because there is historical record of trade (and sometimes war) between the northern and southern sides of the Himalayas, where people obviously went through passes in the mountain.

925,Is American settlement/expansion unique?,1,"Is American settlement/expansion unique?This question came to me after hearing (on video) someone say that [paraphrasing] America was started by European immigrants killing and pushing out the indigenous people, and taking over their lands; now it is a nation of immigrants, and the true native peoples are a tiny minority located in isolated enclaves.

Now, I don't want to start a discussion/argument about the phrasing or attitude of the above position (it's not my position). I want to ask about the concept. I only include the above to hopefully more clearly communicate what I'm asking (by showing the seed of the thought).

Is the American settlement and expansion a historically unique pattern? That is, an obviously/distinctly different people moving into a land, and essentially completely overtaking and replacing the native people as the overwhelmingly dominant race/ethnicity/culture/etc.? Within, what, 200 years? Is that fast or slow compared to other examples?

I know there have been migrations, invasions, etc. throughout human history, all over the world. But I don't know if any of them are on the same scale as in America -- such vastly different ""sides"" (racially/ethnically, culturally, technologically, etc., who didn't even know the other existed), and on such a vast geographical area. 

If this scale is not unique with America, what were the other such massive and thorough migrations and overtakes? What nations now have a population that is completely different than the one that used to live there (without going back thousands of years)? 

I think the Romans were notably different than some of the peoples they conquered and included in the empire, but Roman people didn't really move into those areas and take over as the dominant population (or even a sizable minority), right? It was mostly administrative empire -- correct me if I'm wrong.

Also: I'm saying ""America"" here mostly meaning North America. I've not studied South America's history as much, but I think it's quite a bit different both in how non-indigenous settlement and expansion happened, and how it is currently considered (the real and perceived results).

948,"Can the contemporary myths about the European Middle Ages be considered an entire interconnected Mythos on par with, say, Greek Mythology?",1,"Can the contemporary myths about the European Middle Ages be considered an entire interconnected Mythos on par with, say, Greek Mythology?Most dictionaries have two different definitions for myths or mythologies:

1. Traditional stories often explaining how things came to be
2. Widely held false beliefs

Normally, Greek Mythology would be classified as the first type and the Medieval Flat Earth Myth as the second, but I keep finding parallels between them.

""The Greeks and Romans were really smart, but then the Evil Church‚Ñ¢ came and killed off all knowledge and burned down the Library of Alexandria and caused the Dark Ages and burned 9 million witches that all had red hair, until Da Vinci/Columbus/Copernicus/Galileo dared question the Church's authority and brought us back into the light, and that's why we are allowed to think critically now."" seems a lot like traditional myths when looking at the picture as a whole.

There are alternate versions of events (Did Columbus or Galileo get in trouble for claiming the earth was round?) just like Aphrodite is either the daughter of Zeus and Dione or she formed from the foam when Cronos severed Uranus' gentials. And sometimes there are regional variants (Redheads burned as witches seems to be a uniquely German claim, it isn't claimed as often in English-speaking countries).

And, of course, it's an entire interconnected mess of myths, some of them more specific (The Evil Christians burning down the Library of Alexandria, the Church/Pope declaring the Earth to be flat, the Church/Pope banning Arabic numerals, the Church/Pope banning the number zero)

Some of them more generalized, spanning the whole 1000-year time period (Everyone threw their dung onto the streets, nobody bathed, science lay dormant, the Inquisition killed everyone who disagreed with them).

Some myths have some sort of historical basis but are exaggerated beyond recognition (The Plague was present **the entire time**)

The Black Legend would be a sort of in-between collection of myths, starting out as specifically anti-Spanish but then influencing the grand overarching narrative (exaggeration of the Inquisition)

Could all of this be considered an entire Mythos? If so, what name would there be for it? The Black Legend is already a designation for a part of it, but the most I can find for the Mythos as a whole is the ""Dark Ages Myth"", the ""Conflict Thesis"" or ""The Graph"".

However, I randomly discovered that the humble Mango did much to help Mao end the bloodletting and cultural destruction program he'd started.

The peasants then formed what can only be described as a cult around the fruit and the fruit's ""prophet,"" Mao himself. This came complete with holy relics, idols, ""partaking of the blood (of the mango)"" in an eerily Catholic sort of way, liturgical songs/poems, the persecution of mango heretics and even a holy war!

I also find Japanese history interesting.  I'm not as intrigued by South American history (though I do happen to speak Spanish).  But I don't think I could make a case to others that they would absolutely find Japanese history more interesting than studying Mexican history.

1013,How was French(?) money organized in the 1860s?,1,"How was French(?) money organized in the 1860s?I'm reading *Dostoevsky Portrayed by His Wife: the diary and reminiscences of Mme. Dostoevsky*. We're currently going through Dostoevsky's gambling phase, and I'm at a loss to understand how the denominations of money are ordered or how they might equate to modern money. Helpful to note, they are in Baden, Germany in 1867.

They're using the following phrases: franc, louis, louis d'or, thaler, gulden, coppers, pennies, kreutzers and florins.

Though largely unhelpful, here's what I've found from internet research:

* Wikipedia says that [thalers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaler) were used all over Europe and are somewhat equivalent to the idea of a dollar.
* I think\* [franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_franc), louis and louis d'or might all by synonyms for each other?
* I also think gulden (or the English version [guilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilder), according to Wikipedia), copper, and pennies are all synonymous.

\*Term ""think"" used very loosely here. ""Inclined to believe"" might be more accurate.

I  want to understand, when Fedya gambles their last louis or thaler, which he does often, how dire straights are they really?

Or is this all very literary and I'm doomed to be driven mad by the Dostoevsky's apparently unintelligible finances.

Other records only seem to be in the order the assessor conducted his assessments. It is frustrating. My hat is tipped to researchers who regularly wade through this crap.

Edit: Wow, never expected this kind of response. I honestly expected a bunch of people to tell me to suck it up say that is just the way it is.

These were women who were accused of committing some form of collaboration, most commonly ""Collaboration Horizontale"", which as many of you rightly supposed was a way of saying ""sleeping with the enemy"". Punishments for 'collaboration horizontale' were wide-ranging. The less severe punishments were head-shaving to tarring and feathering, with the more severe forms of punishment including sexual assault and even death. This seemed to happen spontaneously across several areas in France. 

I've collected dozens of photos of France's ""Ugly Carnivals"" and some eyewitness accounts and compiled an Imgur album about it ( **[which can be found in this link](https://imgur.com/a/v5xyi)**).

1034,What is with the really watered down history documentaries with ridiculous amounts of praise?,1,"What is with the really watered down history documentaries with ridiculous amounts of praise?Basically, the old style history documentaries where they constantly heap praise on the topic, explain a few things they did, and then say a generalized narration of events without giving you a very insightful understanding of it or the context which it occurred. I remember watching a documentary in one of my classes about Louis XIV, and they were constantly complimenting him, saying how great he was, about how powerful he was, but they never mentioned a single thing he did. I was just baffled, I mean I knew what he did but the fact that a professional documentary series couldn't convey his story in an interesting way is baffling.

&amp;#x200B;

This comes up because I was watching the Rome documentary series on Netflix, and as soon as they began doing the same thing, heaping praise, calling Rome ""the Greatest Civilization"" with numerous technological advances in sanitation with aqueducts (implying that no one else was doing it) I just stopped watching. They get these esteemed scholars and they keep this kind of out of date format? Or this incredibly exaggerated image of it? They even mentioned the repeated assertion that the city of Rome had a million people, which i'm pretty sure was never confirmed.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels alot like the people making them are so afraid of boring their audience with details and names that they just stick to more childish ways of presenting the information like ""this man good, real good, he do a b c, he do good job you love him"", with no attempt at presenting a more in depth understanding. No attempt at trying to get rid of some common misunderstandings of history. I don't know if these types of documentaries are meant to be for an elementary or a middle school, but it just feels kind of disappointing that they don't try to explain complex historical events. I've read a couple books on historical people and events, and I get how hard it can be to keep track of whats going on when they're throwing around a bunch of names, but it's still possible to present the information in a way that is compelling.

1039,"Was the allied intervention in the Russian civil war a quest out of self-interest (economic,strategic,etc. advantages) or a ideological fight against Bolshevism ?",1,"Was the allied intervention in the Russian civil war a quest out of self-interest (economic,strategic,etc. advantages) or a ideological fight against Bolshevism ?I'm leaning towards self-interest as it started during ww1 when the allies wanted to resurrect an eastern front and prevent the central powers getting materials sent by the allies to russia. On the other hand the allies had clear distain against Bolshevism and  continued their war even though WW1 had ended. Then theres also the split answer where they didnt want Russia to be communist / socialist cause that might mean losing a trade partner and former ""anti-german"" ally. Anyone have an idea?

ps. With Allies I'm particularly interested in the US,UK and France

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I formulated my conclusion I would appreciate any and as much feedback as possible on it.

 

""I believe the allied intervention was a quest out of self-interest. Despite some historians believing in the notion that the allies were engaging in an ideological fight against Bolshevism on the basis that the intervention persisted past the first world war delegitimizing the original justifications given for the intervention. As such they believe the allies lingered in Russia until 1920 so that the Bolsheviks had to concentrate on the internal struggle and could not support the revolutionary waves of socialist and communist uprisings such as the ones in german,hungary and italy or even further exacerbate the first red scare in the US, therefore following a policy of containment. 

I however cant fully agree with this thesis while it would be naive to assume the allies wouldnt have rather seen russia stay a liberal-capitalist society and how they did possess a certain degree of disdain for the bolsheviks and their ideology which saw them denounce all Tsarist foreign debts and would nationalize industries the allies had invested in. Had the allies really wanted to engage in an ideological fight against bolshevism they would invested much more into the intervention,not have deployed their theaters of operation far removed from the Bolshevik-controlled heartland,and have striked in 1919 when the whites had the most probable chance of winning. Furthermore the allies would not have arranged the deceleration of truce among the different contending factions in early 1919. With Lloyd George stating he was ready to deal with the bolsheviks as the de facto government and ‚Äúthe one thing to spread bolshevism was to try and suppress ‚Äú.  Therefore I believe there was never anything resembling ""imperialist intervention"" in the sense of a concerted, purposeful drive of the Western powers to crush the Communist regime and that the intervention was rather rooted in strategic considerations of beating the central powers in world war 1,recouping otherwise lost investments in which a  incidental defeat of the bolsheviks would have been the cherry on top.""",1,wa the alli intervent in the russian civil war a quest out of self interest econom strateg etc advantag or a ideolog fight against bolshev,wa the alli intervent in the russian civil war a quest out of self interest econom strateg etc advantag or a ideolog fight against bolshev I m lean toward self interest as it start dure ww when the alli want to resurrect an eastern front and prevent the central power get materi sent by the alli to russia On the other hand the alli had clear distain against bolshev and continu their war even though WW had end then there also the split answer where they didnt want russia to be communist socialist caus that might mean lose a trade partner and former anti german alli anyon have an idea ps with alli I m particularli interest in the US UK and franc amp x B edit I formul my conclus I would appreci ani and as much feedback as possibl on it I believ the alli intervent wa a quest out of self interest despit some historian believ in the notion that the alli were engag in an ideolog fight against bolshev on the basi that the intervent persist past the first world war delegitim the origin justif given for the intervent As such they believ the alli linger in russia until so that the bolshevik had to concentr on the intern struggl and could not support the revolutionari wave of socialist and communist upris such as the one in german hungari and itali or even further exacerb the first red scare in the US therefor follow a polici of contain I howev cant fulli agre with thi thesi while it would be naiv to assum the alli wouldnt have rather seen russia stay a liber capitalist societi and how they did possess a certain degre of disdain for the bolshevik and their ideolog which saw them denounc all tsarist foreign debt and would nation industri the alli had invest in had the alli realli want to engag in an ideolog fight against bolshev they would invest much more into the intervent not have deploy their theater of oper far remov from the bolshevik control heartland and have strike in when the white had the most probabl chanc of win furthermor the alli would not have arrang the deceler of truce among the differ contend faction in earli with lloyd georg state he wa readi to deal with the bolshevik as the de facto govern and the one thing to spread bolshev wa to tri and suppress therefor I believ there wa never anyth resembl imperialist intervent in the sens of a concert purpos drive of the western power to crush the communist regim and that the intervent wa rather root in strateg consider of beat the central power in world war recoup otherwis lost invest in which a incident defeat of the bolshevik would have been the cherri on top

1044,Recommend me nice Lectures that are online!,1,"Recommend me nice Lectures that are online!Hey there, I need input!  I want to watch nice lectures again. 

I followed the History 210 Course by Paul Freedman about Late Antiquity and it was quite nice.   
I also read Peter Browns Late Antiquity and that was really fascinating.

Recently I read a lot about the Silk Road. I also really enjoyed the BBC In Our Times talks. 

I think I want to learn something new.  Anything goes, but it should not be too dry! 

Topics that could be possible vantage points for me are :

Spice Trade, Monasticism, Early Islam (Abbasids) .. Maybe also something about Explorations or Colonialism. 

I am actually a philosophy student, so everything with philosophical significance is interesting to me. 

Maybe the Renaissance and Antiquity is my biggest gap right now. But seriously the most important thing is, that it is entertaining, and still thoughtful, maybe complex but still not sensationalist or shallow. It should be serious after all.

It seems like there are three perspectives on all conflicts--the the winner, there loser, the outsider. If I'm short on time, which perspective would do most justice to the truth?

Also, do historian methodologies differ from region to region? Or is it more or less standardized like the scientific method?

Case study would be the Middle East. I grew up in the Middle East. Went to college in the US. My history professor played a part in compiling the Manhattan Project papers. Wonderful read. Difficult task to parse much of it. Even more difficult to be objective about it and not color my understanding with my opinions--the indecisiveness of Truman comes to mind based on ""soft"" evidence. Anyway, with my experience with studying a little bit of history in the States, and with the fact that UT Austin had done an amazing job in utilizing an environment that allowed me to cultivate an unfettered and critical mind, I started having many doubts about the history I was taught in my birth country. (No shit, lol).

1105,Native American War Dogs During Spanish Colonization,1,"Native American War Dogs During Spanish ColonizationSo, I was reading about the conquistadors, and found out (as many of you know) that the main advantages they had over the natives were the use of horses, better tech (firearms, metal armor and weapons), diseases, and dogs.  I know there were native dog breeds (not wolves) in the Americas. I am pretty sure they had domesticated dogs.  I am also I am pretty sure the dogs in Europe and the Americas share a common ancestor (the link below claims that the dog breed found in Europe about 14,000 years ago was the same dog breed was found in the Americas about 8,000 years ago according to the wiki link)

So, if the dogs from Europe and the Americas had the same ancestor as the Native American dog breeds, why didn‚Äôt the Natives have a comparable war dog breed to the Spanish?  If they did not (which I would suspect to be the case, but I do not know), why not?  The dog breeds shared the same common ancestor and it has been verified to be in the Americas for nearly 10,000 years.  To me that is enough time for the Natives to develop their own war dog breed regardless of the advantages of the Old World

Yet, the k-12 public school system in the US made it seem like Japan did make a little booboo but really were also victims because we bombed them, so now we are friends, and everything is good and Japan is awesome and only awesome. Yay Abe.

The Japanese education system still glosses over war details in their centralized textbooks, because they don't want their kids to know about the horrendous crimes of the past. (And the gov's official acknowledgment of the crimes are iffy anyways, depending on who you talk to and how it is translated). But why doesnt the U.S. edu system deal with this in a fair way? Yes we sent nuclear bombs and that was truly horrible. But Japan raped and murdered thousands of people and conducted crazy science experiments on people and systematically stripped the language and culture of many people- and the U.S., after WWII, pretry much swept it all under the rug so that we could reap the benefit of a strong ally in Asia and even took the results of the scientific research of those illegal human experiments, etx.

On a related note, it makes me sad to see celebrities and fashion designers use the Japanese Imperial Army flag without the slightest regard to the painful memories it holds for many wartime victims in Asia... and most people have no clue how offensive this is.

Blurb:
In the summer of 1941, at the height of the war in the Western Desert, a bored and eccentric young officer, David Stirling, came up with a plan that was radical and entirely against the rules: a small undercover unit that would inflict mayhem behind enemy lines.

Despite intense opposition, Winston Churchill personally gave Stirling permission to recruit the toughest, brightest and most ruthless soldiers he could find. So began the most celebrated and mysteriousmilitary organization in the world: the SAS.

Now, 75 years later, the SAS has finally decided to tell its astonishing story. It has opened its secret archives for the first time, granting the renowned historian Ben Macintyre full access to a treasure trove of unseen reports, memos,diaries, letters,maps and photographs, as well as free rein to interview surviving Originals and those who knew them.

&amp;#x200B;

I love history and want to take it on at university. I am unsure of what I want to do for a career, however delegation/government/law looks like something I would like. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have two options;

* **Trinity College Dublin - History** \- Ireland's #1 university, ranked top 100 worldwide, top 50 in Europe, very good opportunity and it has the 'college life' I desire. Around 500 - 600 years old, many amazing traditions, historical campus etc. I will be studying history in a place seeped in it. This university is renowned internationally and is just awesome overall.
* **University College Dublin - History &amp; Politics** in my country's #2 university, however it is by a long shot, never made top 100 etc. It is an extremely modern campus further away (less library time etc), more of an engineering/agricultural university, however, the whole idea that political science is possible here makes me wonder should I go here instead and give up on an amazing time at the other university. It is well known, not too sure how known it is, but nationally it is very well known due to the fact that there are not many unis in Ireland. However, I look to work more on the international stage rather than national for the experience and preference.

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck between the both. My question is; Is politics a big part of going into a delegation/government (i.e. United Nations, etc) or is it irrelevant? Will they care whether I have history or history &amp; politics?

1154,What explains Franco's(Spain) ideology regarding democracy and another question about autonomous arrangements during the Second Republic,1,"What explains Franco's(Spain) ideology regarding democracy and another question about autonomous arrangements during the Second RepublicFranco didn't like the idea of the Republic and I've never been able to find anything concrete as to why he disliked the democratic aspects of it. His beliefs surrounding communism were pretty clear and he stated them in the years leading up to the Spanish Civil War. During the strikes in 1934 in which workers, communists, and anarchist led uprisings across Madrid, Barcelona, and Asturias, he once said ""la revoluci√≥n hab√≠a sido concienzudamente preparada por agentes de Mosc√∫""(The revolution had been consciously prepared by agents of Moscow). He also continued to make such statements after WWII since he viewed the Civil War as a victory against communism and used that to build an alliance with the West when he realized that he no longer had fascists allies for support and needed legitimacy.

Where did his beliefs for being anti-democracy come from? Why did he react so strongly to the idea of the Republic? He was pretty young during the 30s. He played politics with king Alfonson to help him get his general position when his associates were much older. Why was he not open to the idea of democracy like other young people were?

My second question has to with the autonomous arrangments that the Republic was preparing on the eve of the war. These arrangements, which are somewhat captured in how Spain is currently structured today, set up Spain in a federal way. These arrangments were aimed at regions of Spain that were not originally part of Castille. Particularly to the Basque Country and Catalonia who sided with the absolutists Carlists in the previous century in exchange for their foral rights. The forals(similiar to charters) had been used to help promote colonization across the peninsula following the Reconquests. When Castille began consolidating in the previous centuries, it eliminated these foral rights apart from a few regions.

During the Second Republic, these agreements were being made for the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia. Andalucia was also in the process of making one. My question is why did Galicia and Andalucia follow suit? From what I've read, although Galicia had been a kingdom before eventually becoming a part of Le√≥n and Castille, it had been pretty much on the sidelines for much of the countries history and pretty poor. The regional language, Galician, was seen as the language of fishermen and peasants. Galician noblemen had been replaced by those from Castille during the medieval period which elevated the language of Castille in the local courts. To my knowledge, Galician institutions didn't continue to exist as they were integrated into the Castillian court. The same for Andalusia minus the local language since it didn't have one and it had been repopulated following the Reconquest. Compared to Galicia, it had been much more important and was wealthier at one point in the countries history. Who were the ones pushing for such arrangments and why?",1,what explain franco s spain ideolog regard democraci and anoth question about autonom arrang dure the second republ,what explain franco s spain ideolog regard democraci and anoth question about autonom arrang dure the second republicfranco didn t like the idea of the republ and I ve never been abl to find anyth concret as to whi he dislik the democrat aspect of it hi belief surround commun were pretti clear and he state them in the year lead up to the spanish civil war dure the strike in in which worker communist and anarchist led upris across madrid barcelona and asturia he onc said la revoluci n hab a sido concienzudament preparada por agent de mosc the revolut had been conscious prepar by agent of moscow He also continu to make such statement after wwii sinc he view the civil war as a victori against commun and use that to build an allianc with the west when he realiz that he no longer had fascist alli for support and need legitimaci where did hi belief for be anti democraci come from whi did he react so strongli to the idea of the republ He wa pretti young dure the s He play polit with king alfonson to help him get hi gener posit when hi associ were much older whi wa he not open to the idea of democraci like other young peopl were My second question ha to with the autonom arrang that the republ wa prepar on the eve of the war these arrang which are somewhat captur in how spain is current structur today set up spain in a feder way these arrang were aim at region of spain that were not origin part of castil particularli to the basqu countri and catalonia who side with the absolutist carlist in the previou centuri in exchang for their foral right the foral similiar to charter had been use to help promot colon across the peninsula follow the reconquest when castil began consolid in the previou centuri it elimin these foral right apart from a few region dure the second republ these agreement were be made for the basqu countri catalonia and galicia andalucia wa also in the process of make one My question is whi did galicia and andalucia follow suit from what I ve read although galicia had been a kingdom befor eventu becom a part of Le n and castil it had been pretti much on the sidelin for much of the countri histori and pretti poor the region languag galician wa seen as the languag of fishermen and peasant galician noblemen had been replac by those from castil dure the mediev period which elev the languag of castil in the local court To my knowledg galician institut didn t continu to exist as they were integr into the castillian court the same for andalusia minu the local languag sinc it didn t have one and it had been repopul follow the reconquest compar to galicia it had been much more import and wa wealthier at one point in the countri histori who were the one push for such arrang and whi

1156,What should high school history teaching cover/achieve?,1,"What should high school history teaching cover/achieve?Or secondary school here in UK, or equivalent in your country? Essentially, what do you spend the last 3-5 years teaching kids about history, most of whom will never study it at higher level? 

The recent thread about teaching ancient history made me wonder what people think the purpose is. For instance, I reckon it's some combination of

1. Equipping someone with a basic frame of historical reference so that when they hear claims/statements about history in the future they can place them in some context \[in my experience, this is a bit of a weakness in UK due to move away from timelines/narrative in favour of a series of spotlights\]

2. As above but more specifically history as it's relevant to where we are *now*. So understanding historical basis behind our political systems, economies etc. with a particular emphasis on the country being taught about (this one is inevitably quite tough as it's vulnerable to major ideological battles over the correct interpretation of these things)

3. Teach some awareness/aptitude in historical method: different sorts of sources, limits on what we know etc. Useful for history and more widely

4. Give kids the opportunity to have their interest sparked in history (which is partially ability of teacher, but I think also suggests you want to focus in on some varied things as different  kids will be inspired by different aspects)

Having written this I've looked up the English [national curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study) and it's a reasonably good match (recent reforms I think brought back in more narrative history). The main thing that leaps out at me is that I'm not sure if you can teach about the histories of 'these islands' without wider reference. For instance, I think any teaching of history that left out the French Revolution or the rise of Communism and the Cold War would fail to meet the requirements above. Similarly I'm not sure if that history is understood to include the impact of the British Empire and its dissolution (though this is flagged as the sort of thing that *could* be included, and I recognise it's quite hard to teach as its interpretation is quite ideologically weighted).",1,what should high school histori teach cover achiev,what should high school histori teach cover achiev Or secondari school here in UK or equival in your countri essenti what do you spend the last year teach kid about histori most of whom will never studi it at higher level the recent thread about teach ancient histori made me wonder what peopl think the purpos is for instanc I reckon it s some combin of equip someon with a basic frame of histor refer so that when they hear claim statement about histori in the futur they can place them in some context in my experi thi is a bit of a weak in UK due to move away from timelin narr in favour of a seri of spotlight As abov but more specif histori as it s relev to where we are now So understand histor basi behind our polit system economi etc with a particular emphasi on the countri be taught about thi one is inevit quit tough as it s vulner to major ideolog battl over the correct interpret of these thing teach some awar aptitud in histor method differ sort of sourc limit on what we know etc use for histori and more wide give kid the opportun to have their interest spark in histori which is partial abil of teacher but I think also suggest you want to focu in on some vari thing as differ kid will be inspir by differ aspect amp x B have written thi I ve look up the english nation curriculum http www gov uk govern public nation curriculum in england histori programm of studi nation curriculum in england histori programm of studi and it s a reason good match recent reform I think brought back in more narr histori the main thing that leap out at me is that I m not sure if you can teach about the histori of these island without wider refer for instanc I think ani teach of histori that left out the french revolut or the rise of commun and the cold war would fail to meet the requir abov similarli I m not sure if that histori is understood to includ the impact of the british empir and it dissolut though thi is flag as the sort of thing that could be includ and I recognis it s quit hard to teach as it interpret is quit ideolog weight

I mean I know a tiny bit about American submarines in the war, and how they basically did the same thing as the U-Boats, taking out Japanese merchant vessels as well as their warships but all the knowledge I have is very vague. In fact the most specific thing I know about American submarines is that for the first year or two when they were fighting they were fighting with a defective torpedo that would fail to explode way more than one would expect.

and that is a lot compared to what I know of the British submarines, which is essentially nothing. I once recall reading that a British submarine managed to destroy a German submarine underwater, and it being the only time it happened in the war, but that is all I know. I don't know how many British subs there were, or what they really did during the war.

So my general question is about British and American submarines in general, as well as why they are not really talked about in WW2 documentaries, at least nowhere near as much as the German U-Boats. Were the American and British submarine programs just so small they don't really warrant much discussion, or was there some other reason?",1,what did british and american submarin do in WW,what did british and american submarin do in WW I consid myself a bit of a fan of WW histori but even after watch more documentari than I can count on WW includ quit a lot on the battl of the atlant I have often wonder whi british and american submarin action are rare talk about I mean I know a tini bit about american submarin in the war and how they basic did the same thing as the U boat take out japanes merchant vessel as well as their warship but all the knowledg I have is veri vagu In fact the most specif thing I know about american submarin is that for the first year or two when they were fight they were fight with a defect torpedo that would fail to explod way more than one would expect and that is a lot compar to what I know of the british submarin which is essenti noth I onc recal read that a british submarin manag to destroy a german submarin underwat and it be the onli time it happen in the war but that is all I know I don t know how mani british sub there were or what they realli did dure the war So my gener question is about british and american submarin in gener as well as whi they are not realli talk about in WW documentari at least nowher near as much as the german U boat were the american and british submarin program just so small they don t realli warrant much discuss or wa there some other reason

After the Dirty War inside the country was over, Videla and Galtieri (and Chile‚Äôs Pinochet) assisted US backed right ring wing militias in both overthrowing left-leaning governments and finding/killing suspected communists all over S America. So in a way, Argentina (&amp; Chile) sort of ran shit down there and pretty much controlled the entire continent. If Argentina was acting like an empire, well that‚Äôs because the US essentially made Argentina into a regional ‚Äúempire‚Äù and got them to think that way.

In all likelihood, a British victory would be the end of the military regime, and a likely end for Argentine support of anti-communist terrorist militias across the continent. I‚Äôm surprised Britain showed up the USA and the CIA by going to war with Galtieri, although I am aware that the US dropped support for Galtieri when he invaded the Falklands. I thought the Brits would basically look at the Americans with dismay saying ‚Äúthis loss is on YOU‚Äù but not actually do anything about it.

The Cold War was still raging at this time so I figured the CIA would have wanted to keep Galtieri in power at any cost. And I figured as a partner of the CIA, MI-6 would have told Thatcher ‚Äúlook Galtieri is a nut job, our diplomats won‚Äôt recognize the annexation but we need him in power while the Cold War continues, so no invasions‚Äù and stopped Thatcher‚Äôs invasion full stop.

Could MI-6 have stepped in and said ‚Äúhey, we know this is our territory but the CIA wants to keep Galtieri‚Äôs people happy, so we just have to let them have this one.‚Äù?

The belt is 6-feet long and contains ten thousand beads. It depicts a house in the middle, representing the Six Nations. The Mohawk are the keepers of the eastern door and the Seneca the keepers of the western door. They are holding hands with 13 others, representing the 13 United States. (The historian I'm currently reading as well as the Onondaga website say they represent 13 states, but Kentucky and Vermont were already admitted to the union)

The wampum symbolizes friendship with the Six Nations Iroquois and is a visual representation of the Treaty of Canandaigua. This treaty is commemorated annually on November 11, where U.S. officials distribute cloth to fulfill the terms of the treaty.

I know it is subjective, and we would have to define talent, and many other things impeding a proper and certain answer. But I just wanted to make a small thought experiment. Also, I wanted to know who are the 3 men with the most positive and who with the most negative impacts.

1237,Piousness of different nations during the middle ages?,1,"Piousness of different nations during the middle ages?Kind of a broad question but it's one I've not seen too many people discuss. We're aware that Mediterranean states were more pious than others even before the reformation however are there many notable differences in the piousness of different European nations during this period? 

It's mostly based on what people have told me and what I've been unable to confirm through research but I've heard that  there was a difference between the Norman invaders and the Anglo-Saxons in terms of their views/relationship with the church. Normans were apparently vastly more pious than the Anglo-saxons who were still mixing a good amount of Pagan originating folklore into their lives.

1238,European Universities and Modern Times vs Renaissance.,1,"European Universities and Modern Times vs Renaissance.I've often though about the establishment of the European universities and the transition to modern time.   The breakneck speed of inventions and new ideas in the European Late Middle Ages and Early Modern period are astounding.  Technology was invented then that is still hlghly recogzinable today in the tech world. I've often thought that the real transition to modern times was the Catholic Church being more permissive on orthodoxy and not calling threatening ideas heresy.  One visual manifestation was the art renaissance in Florence, but it was a result of the revolution going on, not causal.  

heres a list of some of my favorite people to read about during the European Medieval and Early modern period and there strong connections to the University system.  I am interested in finding out more about the establishment of the modern university system which seems to have started in around 1050.

1239,Could Stalin's policies in the 1930's Be Viewed as Simply a Continuation of Lenin's Work? Or a radical break?,1,"Could Stalin's policies in the 1930's Be Viewed as Simply a Continuation of Lenin's Work? Or a radical break?Much contentious debate has been made in recent revisionist History arguing that Stalinism is the extreme perversion of Leninism caused by Stalin's ""Bonapartist"" approach to governance. But should we view Stalin's policies as continuation and amendment of Lenin's work or as a deliberate break away due to his lust for power? 

&amp;#x200B;

But for a moment, can we not assume that the Stalinist policies of the mid-1930s are simply Stalin's adaptations to the challenges the state faced during that period?  


\- The great terror for example, was the unhinged use of the states monopoly of power, but the methodology for the purges was largely developed during the Russian civil war, which at the time was largely supported by Stalin  


\- Stalin's shift towards ""communism in one country"" instead of a global ongoing revolution can be seen as an adaptation to the fact that Lenin's predictions of a domino effect of socialist uprisings in Europe did not come into play. In fact, in Lenin's last testament he expressed the willingness to forge the global goals in favour of stabilising the domestic situation.   


\- Stalin's economic policy following Lenin's NEP, again could be seen as simply a necessary step to avoid the empowerment of a new capitalist class and a necessary deviation in order to accelerate collectivisation and industrialisation.   


On the other hand of course we can argue that Stalin labeled much of his policies as ""continuations"" of Lenin's work simply to gain legitimacy. But couldn't it be argued regardless that the very policies Lenin implemented in the 1920s and during the civil war simply shaped the way for Stalin's policies? ",1,could stalin s polici in the s Be view as simpli a continu of lenin s work Or a radic break,could stalin s polici in the s Be view as simpli a continu of lenin s work Or a radic break much contenti debat ha been made in recent revisionist histori argu that stalin is the extrem pervers of lenin caus by stalin s bonapartist approach to govern but should we view stalin s polici as continu and amend of lenin s work or as a deliber break away due to hi lust for power amp x B but for a moment can we not assum that the stalinist polici of the mid s are simpli stalin s adapt to the challeng the state face dure that period the great terror for exampl wa the unhing use of the state monopoli of power but the methodolog for the purg wa larg develop dure the russian civil war which at the time wa larg support by stalin stalin s shift toward commun in one countri instead of a global ongo revolut can be seen as an adapt to the fact that lenin s predict of a domino effect of socialist upris in europ did not come into play In fact in lenin s last testament he express the willing to forg the global goal in favour of stabilis the domest situat stalin s econom polici follow lenin s nep again could be seen as simpli a necessari step to avoid the empower of a new capitalist class and a necessari deviat in order to acceler collectivis and industrialis On the other hand of cours we can argu that stalin label much of hi polici as continu of lenin s work simpli to gain legitimaci but couldn t it be argu regardless that the veri polici lenin implement in the s and dure the civil war simpli shape the way for stalin s polici

1242,History of War: We went from big pointy stick to total annihilation pretty quickly.,1,"History of War: We went from big pointy stick to total annihilation pretty quickly.For. The. Longest. Time. 


We have used the spear in an effective capacity to hunt and fight since before recorded history. 

Yes, there were other inventions which were formidable, like the bow and then the sword. But these weapons require many many hours of practice and very good materials and skilled craftsmen to create. 

When we watch movies, they often use the sword in battle or some other weapon. But when soldiers train together, the spear was the most effective weapon to be used in formation. 

The benefits of a spear are that it is very easy to use, very easy to make and very cheap. Minimal hours of input for maximum output. Perfect in so many ways with so little flaws. Very good when used in coordination with others, this covers its weaknesses. 

Even in the Renaissance, you had firearms, cavalry and halberdiers. Like games of Rock, paper , scissors. 
Cavalry &gt; Firearms (at the time)
Firearms &gt; Halberdiers
Halberdiers &gt; Cavalry

Then finally, the firearm came to prominence as the dominant weapon of choice... for a comparable speck of time... before WW2

We saw 2 cities evaporate. And decided to better keep the atom bomb as a mere threat. Never to be actually used. Hopefully. 

Timeline:
Spear____ 1 million years! Used to effect up the asses of US GIs in the Vietnam War. Astounding. 

Firearm__ 1364-present. About 600 years dominant.

There were numerous wars which went on for years and decades such as the Thirty Years War and the Napoleonic Wars and I don't recall learning about anti-war sentiment during them. In addition, there were various major and minor conflicts in Greek, Roman and Medieval periods in history.

But it made me wonder, what do we actually know about Leif Erickson‚Äôs moral character, if we were to judge him similarly to Columbus?

He was a Viking. His father and grandfather were exiled for killings. His brother killed Vinland natives. But what about Leif? Was he considered a moral man for the time, unlike Columbus? And would we consider him a moral man to our standards today, likely an impossible task?

What I‚Äôm asking is, did Leif: Rape, kill natives, kill women &amp; children, take slaves/prisoners of war, subject people to cruel forms of punishment, or extort people?

1288,What inventions or discoveries likely would not have come to be if the person we credit for the discovery didn't figure it out?,1,"What inventions or discoveries likely would not have come to be if the person we credit for the discovery didn't figure it out?Let me give examples:

**The lightbulb** as we know it is something we likely would have discovered without edison or tesla, since (as i understand it) many people were trying to solve the problem of how to create a steady, reliable light source that didn't burn. It was a practical solution to a problem that many people were looking for a solution to. (I'm not a historian on the light bulb, so if you feel i have some details off let me know).

**penicillin** Is something that we discovered almost entirely on accident. Alexander fleming had a lab so messy, mold was growing on his petri dishes. One of them just so happened to be penicillin notatum, which was killing the bacteria in his dishes. He later said of that moment, ""when i woke up just after dawn on september 28th, 1928, i certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But i guess that was exactly what i did.""

Its interesting to me that we stumbled across antibiotics like that, after slowly accumulating evidence that bacteria existed and caused infections, with germ theory beginning to be accepted by louis pasteur in the 1860's, with more evidence being found and experiments being conducted by robert koch in the following decades. Koch spent years of his life trying to find a vaccine for tuberculosis, where Fleming got lucky out of the blue.

I know there's more to the story of penicillin and antibiotics than what I've said, and maybe an antibiotic would have been discovered in the years or even months after Fleming got lucky. But i can't help but wonder what the world would have been like if antibiotics weren't discovered for another decade, or even after world war 2. It makes me wonder what other famous influential discoveries or inventions happened almost entirely by accident. What other examples of this are there?

1369,Was there much contact between North and South American nations before 1492?,1,"Was there much contact between North and South American nations before 1492?I used to think that North and South American nations were practically isolated from each other due to a lack of long-distance seafaring technology and the [Dari√©n Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dari%C3%A9n_Gap) making land travel between them extremely difficult.

[Maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize) was domesticated in the [Balsas River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsas_River) Valley of south-central Mexico. But somehow, it is commonly grown on the West coast of South America. According to a genetic study by [Embrapa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Agricultural_Research_Corporation), corn cultivation was introduced in South America from Mexico, in two great waves: the first, more than 6000 years ago, spread through the [Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes). [Evidence of cultivation in Peru has been found dating to about 6700 years ago](http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2012/01/120118_peru_maiz_antiguedad_jgc.shtml).

1371,Did Thomas Jefferson rape Sally Hemmings? Does it matter? I believe it does.,1,"Did Thomas Jefferson rape Sally Hemmings? Does it matter? I believe it does.Background: So I‚Äôm currently enrolled at the flagship university in my state. I will graduate this May with my bachelors degree in history. I am in a class that covers the age of the Founding Fathers of America with a special emphasis on Thomas Jefferson. My professor is actually one of the most famous scholars on Jefferson and it is truly a pleasure taking his class. Today we were discussing Jefferson‚Äôs relationship with his slave Sally Hemmings. For you that don‚Äôt know, the question of whether Jefferson engaged in a relationship with Hemmings was contested in American History until the late 90‚Äôs where Jefferson‚Äôs DNA was found in several African Americans and matched Jefferson‚Äôs lineage from his wife, Patty Jefferson. So it is now widely accepted that Jefferson had a relationship with her. 

My problem: During the lecture, my professor would use many euphemisms to describe the relationship: ‚Äúhe had his way with her,‚Äù ‚Äúthey engaged in sexual relations,‚Äù ‚Äúhe fancied her,‚Äù etc.
I asked him why we didn‚Äôt call this rape? My professor responded that we didn‚Äôt know if it was rape or not, as we do not know the feelings involved, just that the results were the children. 
I let the issue drop during class but afterwards I approached him and restarted the discussion.
My point is that to describe Jefferson‚Äôs relationship (and by extension any other relations that existed between slave masters and slaves, or even between unequals) as anything other than rape is simply untrue. There was no way Hemmings could consent to Jefferson because she was his property; even if she did have some romantic feelings for him could they ever have been divorced from the reality of her enslavement? What if she wasn‚Äôt feeling the sex that day, could she have refused Jefferson? 
My professor said that he understood where I was coming from but by labeling Jefferson a rapist, that it closed the conversation and ignored the complexities (Hemmings was actually the half sister of Jefferson‚Äôs late wife and her family may have had a privileged status at Monticello). We should perhaps say that Hemmings lacked consent. 
While I agree that the use of the word rape may appear provocative, I cannot in consciousness describe the occasion in any other fashion. And I am not doing so to ‚Äúpick‚Äù on Jefferson (many, many men engaged in similar behavior all throughout history), but rather to argue that the rhetoric we use to describe history matters.
We should be able to say that Jefferson raped Sally Hemmings and continue the conversation. To use euphemisms is to distort history, no matter how provocative or painful it may be to admit.

Is the process really THAT slow? Or do you think that there may have been civilizations that developed before Sumeria, but we just don‚Äôt have any concrete evidence of them quite yet?

And I need more precise location, like ""he attacked ship near the port of... something"", is it even possible to get this kind of descriptions?  
I've researched already couple of pirates and managed to get things like that only for Henry Morgan.

What books/websites/sources should I have look into?  


Do you know of any pirates for whom I can get information I am looking for?

Thanks for all help!!

In the book, there were still many Comanche raids into settlements well into the mid-late 1800s and seemingly much of the land wasn't developed yet. 

It seems like California and Florida were also settled hundreds of years later than the ""older states"" to the northeast. Yet these 3 states are currently the most populated states in the country and the USA is the third most populated country on the planet.

1387,Was Henry II of England a popular king?,1,"Was Henry II of England a popular king? I'm confused. On the wikipedia of Frederick I it says:  


*Historians have compared Frederick to Henry II of England.* ***Both were considered the greatest and most charismatic leaders of their age.*** *Each possessed a rare combination of qualities that made him appear superhuman to his contemporaries: longevity, boundless ambition, extraordinary organizing skill, and greatness on the battlefield. Both were handsome and proficient in courtly skills, without appearing effeminate or affected. Both came to the throne in the prime of manhood. Each had an element of learning, without being considered impractical intellectuals but rather more inclined to practicality. Each found himself in the possession of new legal institutions that were put to creative use in governing. Both Henry and Frederick were viewed to be sufficiently and formally devout to the teachings of the Church, without being moved to the extremes of spirituality seen in the great saints of the 12th century. In making final decisions, each relied solely upon his own judgment,\[84\] and both were interested in gathering as much power as they could.*   


But on his own wiki it says:  


*Henry was not a popular king and few expressed much grief on news of his death.\[355\] Writing in the 1190s, William of Newburgh commented that ""****in his own time he was hated by almost everyone****""; he was widely criticised by his own contemporaries, even within his own court.*

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)

For some people the unification was reached by force and cruelty on submitted populations: the Savoy's Kingdom only applied its constitution in all Italian land and when some people revolted they just sent troops, an example is the South's revolt of ""Brigantaggio"", when the farmers(but also the Borbonic military and the church) rose up because Garibaldi(during the Expedition of the Thousand) promised them the redistribution of the lands that in fact never happened. There are still so much controversies about this, because others says that the ""Brigantaggio"" existed even under Two Sicilies and in the first times of Unity the Savoys were not able to handle it.

Another controversy is about Garibaldi: the majority consider him a national hero, but someone think that he was a liar, an opportunist who won just because he was supported by the English.

It was a Cold War political maneuver by Reagan, as pope John Paul II was an influential anti-communist, but it still struck me as odd that America, a country with massive Catholic immigrant populations (Ireland, Italy, etc.), did not have diplomatic ties with one of the most powerful institutions in Christian society. This realization put the influence of America's puritan roots into perspective, and also got me thinking:

When did anti-Catholicism die down in the states and UK?

1432,The Romanian Revolution of 1989 gives me chills,1,"The Romanian Revolution of 1989 gives me chillsI don't know all the ins and outs about the anti-communist revolutions of 1989. I'm a political science major, so I have a good handle on basics. The Romanian regime was one of the most repressive of the Soviet bloc, with a crushing secret police and other typical totalitarian characteristics. Nicolae Ceausescu, the country's dictator, had completely mismanaged the economy, making it extremely poor/hard for people to survive. But yesterday, I saw some of the videos from those final days and it gave me chills. 

There's one video of a staged rally organized by the Labor Party in Bucharest to show support for Ceausescu. This was right after he had ordered soldiers to fire on peaceful protesters a few days before in another part of the country, resulting in the deaths of 17 people. But the workers were forced to come to this rally and stand in the cold for hours, probably so frustrated. You can see all of them there in the bewildering numbers that communist totalitarian regimes put together, like in North Korea today. Then, you see Ceausescu giving his speech, thanking the organizers of the rally. He calls it ""this great popular meeting in Bucharest"".

That's when the crowd collectively lose their sh\*t, and start jeering and shouting at Ceausescu. They're done with the lies and the BS. But as you hear the noise swell, all you can see is Ceausescu, a little old man by himself at a podium, raising his hand to try to calm them down. He looks completely taken aback. As the shouts of the crowd get louder and louder the feed cuts off, as the broadcasters realized how bad this made them look to Romanians at home.

As a person who cares about human rights, but also as a student of political science, this short video is fascinating to me in a few ways. It makes me think about two sides of this: what is going through the minds of the people, and what is going through the mind of Ceausescu at that moment. Buckle up, because this is about to get a bit nerdy. I'm going to talk about a couple of theories on authoritarian regimes, and how they can help us understand this event.

In his book, The Politics of Uncertainty, Andreas Schedler talks about the ironic weakness of totalitarian regimes: the performative behavior of everyone inside it. This includes the people, the elites, and the dictator himself. When you have a state like Romania with extremely extensive surveillance and secret police, everyone is paranoid and everyone is forced to ACT like they're loyal to the regime. At first, this is good for the dictator, as it becomes difficult for defectors to connect with each other, based on the fact that everyone has to act like they love the regime. If you don't, there's the huge risk that someone who hears you will sell you out. This disrupts any resistance efforts really well. But ironically, this eventually becomes a weakness, as the dictator and his elite circle are unable to gauge exactly how much dissent there really is, since everybody is basically lying to you through their teeth at any moment. I think this explains the bewilderment we see on Ceausescu's face when the crowd starts jeering at him. Obviously, he had to know that SOME people didn't like him. There was that protest a few days before. But I bet he had no idea about the extent to which people hated him until it was right in his face. He had started to believe the lie he created, that he was loved by the Romanian people. On the other hand, I bet the crowd was just as surprised by themselves as Ceausescu was in them. It must have been such a powerful moment - you're standing there in the cold, at a rally you don't even want to be at for a leader who has destroyed your country. Maybe you get so fed up you shout something without thinking about it. Before you know it, the whole area around you is filled with sound as you realize you're not alone.

In Timur Kuran's piece called ""Now Out of Never"", he specifically talked about the 1989 revolutions, and how they took everyone involved by surprised. Kuran has this theory of ""revolutionary thresholds"", basically how many people have to be in the streets before you as an individual go out too. Some people will go out and protest alone, they're that ballsy. But most aren't like that. They need to see that there's a certain number of people out there before they feel comfortable about doing it too, basically like a cost-benefit analysis. Going back to why the people started shouting at the rally. These were workers who knew the consequences of openly showing dissent. At first, probably one or two people said something. That gave more people confidence to participate, then more and more like a snowball effect, and then in a few moments the revolution is underway.

Anyway, I just think it's so fascinating. The video is a 4:29 brief overview you can easily find on YouTube. Be warned, there are some disturbing images in it.

1434,Some translations of primary sources relating to the Mongol Empire,1,"Some translations of primary sources relating to the Mongol EmpirePrimary sources are the most important part of any historical study, for they are one of the ways that information from the past is transferred to us. In my own videos I increasingly try to make greater use of them, and to aid in the efforts and interests of others, below I will link the english (and two french) translations I have found freely accessible online.

Richard's part 3 translation of Ibn al-Athir, that would be much obliged! Likewise, for the full text of Rashid al-Din)

If any links don't work, please let me know and I'l see if I can do anything about them. I tried to keep them roughly categorized, but the Bretscheinder/Henri Yule/Hakluyt Society works at the end didn't quite fit neatly into that. If you have a question about a particular source or who it was that wrote it, also feel free to ask. I do apologize for wonky formatting (due to the transition from Google Docs to websites!) or ramshackle citation (rather spur of the moment to share it).

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a fan of the AlternateHistoryHub channal and the entertaining videos that come out of it, however the most recent video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLiI6kXZkZI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=46&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLiI6kXZkZI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=46&amp;t=0s), is what I believe to be a prime example of bad history. Now I'm certainly not an expert and I have never written in this sub before, but this video has stirred something of a firestorm in my mind due to its wide assumptions on what people should've done and how history would've played out differently had \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happened, which was enough to motivate myself to write about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now one thing I have noticed about contemporary discussions on history is that people like to blame our misery on specific people or events from the past, and this video seems to lay the Big Kahuna that was the misery of the 20th century on the shoulder's of Woodrow Wilson; outright stating that he was the worst president ever. How does the video justify this opinion? Mainly with two arguments: Joining WW1 late and Wilson's desire to ""Spread Democracy."" These are points that deserve much scrutiny so I'll break down both.

&amp;#x200B;

Joining WW1 Late.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the two arguments this one atleast has the most merit, but even then it is extremely flawed. While it is obvious that the first world war would've ended sooner had the U.S. joined the war a year or two earlier, that arugment relies heavily on the ""had"" part of that sentence. The video makes the assumption that if Teddy Roosevelt was elected president in 1912 instead of Woodrow Wilson, the U.S. mighted entered the war in 1915 instead. Now this just seems ridiculous to me, I mean how would the people of the U.S. agree to such a thing? The vast majority of the population was against joining following the first couple of years of the war breaking out, and even then many people in the U.S. that were pro war wanted to join GERMANY'S side and not the entente's. In addition just look at when the European powers decided to intervene: Britain joined only after Germany violated Belgium's neutrality, Italy and Blugraria joined in 1915, Romania and Portugal in 1916, and Greece in 1917. These were all nations that were in the middle of the action and had way more reason to join the conflict but still took their time, yet somehow Roosevelt was going to slap two dicks together and make the U.S. join in 1915? This is a nation that still largely view itself as detached from European affairs and hadn't engaged in major conflicts outside of the Americas. The people weren't about to join the war early due to the sinking of a single cruise liner that just happened to carry Americans. It just seems like a far fetched fantasy, and if it actually occured would've most likely resulted in Teddy getting the boot in the 1916 elections as soon as hundreds of thousands of American coffins started coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

Even then, so what if the U.S. had joined the war early? The video implies that if Germany was defeated a year or two earlier (which is optimistic) then there wouldn't have been a rise of facism or a Bolshevik revolution (assuming that the revolution doesn't occur anyways)? Well one can just as easily make the point that had the allies done more to intervene in the Russian civil war the whites could've won preventing the rise of the Soviet Union, or had the allies not been so harsh on Gemany in Versailles and ironically had listened more to Wilson then Hitler wouldn't have risen to power, etc. And even if there is no USSR or Nazi Germany, that doesn't mean that other tradegies wouldn't have followed. One can spend all day imagining different scenarios playing out such as a war between the west and the hegemonic Russian empire or a falling out of relations between Britain and France, etc. The point is that a WW1 that ends sooner does not necessarily bring the world down a more peaceful path.

&amp;#x200B;

Wilson's ideas on ""Spreading Democracy"" and American Interventionism.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this argument is just a really bad one. The video seems to make the point that Wilson's biggest mistake was starting the legacy of Wilsonian Intervensionism. America was already an interventionist power well before Wilson, such as establishing trade relations in Asia, expanding imperially in the Phillipines, the Pacific, and Carribeans, and engaging in ""local affairs"" in Latin America. The main difference with Wilson's ideology was that he wanted to intervene and stay in the name of spreading American democracy around the world and not just for business or territorial gain ( not that this always worked out perfectly ). He argued at Versailles for national determination and was vehemently against strictly punishing Germany for the war, opposing what France wanted. The failure to listen to Wilson created a shitty hybrid compromise where Germany was punshied enough to instill nationalist zeal and hatred but not enough to prevent German rearmament (although granted the unwillingness of the allies to resist Hitler until it was too late also didn't help). That and the eventually republican withdrawal from the league of nations, was very much a significant contributor to the downward spiral that led to the second world war. The video also seems to argue that if we had followed Roosevelt's ""big stick diplomacy,"" or the ""get in, get out"" approach; the U.S. would've been better off, using the Gulf War as an example. This again doesn't invalidate the Wilsonian approach however. While the ""big stick"" method works well in a situation like the gulf war where the goal wasn't to spread democracy but to prevent Iraq from threatening it, It would've failed in other conflicts. The Wilsonian approach worked well in Europe and Japan following WW2, as well as Korea, since it was crucial that the U.S. remained in those nations to insure that Democracy would take hold so that they do not succumb to Communist influence and remained allies.

&amp;#x200B;

We are very much blinded by our interventionist failures in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Africa to see what good American Intervention has brought to the world. Those failures were not brought on by the Wilsonian apporach, but by the fact that no proper apporach was used at all. Either way for every failure of American intervention, there are at least half a dozen success stories. Today 3/4 of the planet's nations are democracies, compared to less than a quarter at the time of Wilson. Most of these democracies are allied to the U.S., and nowhere in the world are there major conflicts going on because of this. We live in the most peaceful times there have ever been and the average human's level of wealth and freedom is at it's peak. This is undeniably a result of American influence, and a lot of it stems from Wilson and his 14 points, however flawed a man he was.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, I know this is maybe not the best written essay but I'm not exactly an experienced writer, I'm just trying to convey my thoughts and feelings about AlternateHistoryHub's video. It just seems unfair that Wilson is taking so much shit in the video and is talked about like he's the devil himself. Of course, he was still an extremely flawed figure, and his views on racism are rather disgusting and leave much to be desired. That doesn't mean that he was a horrible person, and it frankly is childish to just blame him for our current problems today. The fact is that with or without him there still would be racism, we still would've had horrible wars, and we still would be stuck in crappy conflicts. Either way one can say he's responsible for much good in the world just as easily as one can blame him for our misery.

&amp;#x200B;

History does not revolve around single individuals who are solely responsible for our woes, it is a chaotic mess of randomness that doesn't follow a logical path. Judging people by the events that transpired decades following their decisions is foolish, because people act in the way they think is best at the time of making their decisions and do not have control over random events that might taint their legacy in the future. They do not have the benefit of hindsight like we do. Afterall, when Bush and Obama decided to intervene in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Lybia, there weren't thinking ""Damn, Woodrow Wilson made me do this,"" they were acting on their own decisions, and it is up to the people of the present to correct the present's mistakes. Afterall, blaming the problems of today on the people of the past merely gives us a comfortable excuse to not correct the problems ourselves, which only prolongs our misery.

play out differ had happen which wa enough to motiv myself to write about it amp x B now one thing I have notic about contemporari discuss on histori is that peopl like to blame our miseri on specif peopl or event from the past and thi video seem to lay the big kahuna that wa the miseri of the th centuri on the shoulder s of woodrow wilson outright state that he wa the worst presid ever how doe the video justifi thi opinion mainli with two argument join WW late and wilson s desir to spread democraci these are point that deserv much scrutini so I ll break down both amp x B join WW late amp x B out of the two argument thi one atleast ha the most merit but even then it is extrem flaw while it is obviou that the first world war would ve end sooner had the U S join the war a year or two earlier that arug reli heavili on the had part of that sentenc the video make the assumpt that if teddi roosevelt wa elect presid in instead of woodrow wilson the U S might enter the war in instead now thi just seem ridicul to me I mean how would the peopl of the U S agre to such a thing the vast major of the popul wa against join follow the first coupl of year of the war break out and even then mani peopl in the U S that were pro war want to join germani S side and not the entent s In addit just look at when the european power decid to interven britain join onli after germani violat belgium s neutral itali and blugraria join in romania and portug in and greec in these were all nation that were in the middl of the action and had way more reason to join the conflict but still took their time yet somehow roosevelt wa go to slap two dick togeth and make the U S join in thi is a nation that still larg view itself as detach from european affair and hadn t engag in major conflict outsid of the america the peopl weren t about to join the war earli due to the sink of a singl cruis liner that just happen to carri american It just seem like a far fetch fantasi and if it actual occur would ve most like result in teddi get the boot in the elect as soon as hundr of thousand of american coffin start come back amp x B even then so what if the U S had join the war earli the video impli that if germani wa defeat a year or two earlier which is optimist then there wouldn t have been a rise of facism or a bolshevik revolut assum that the revolut doesn t occur anyway well one can just as easili make the point that had the alli done more to interven in the russian civil war the white could ve won prevent the rise of the soviet union or had the alli not been so harsh on gemani in versail and iron had listen more to wilson then hitler wouldn t have risen to power etc and even if there is no ussr or nazi germani that doesn t mean that other tradegi wouldn t have follow one can spend all day imagin differ scenario play out such as a war between the west and the hegemon russian empir or a fall out of relat between britain and franc etc the point is that a WW that end sooner doe not necessarili bring the world down a more peac path amp x B wilson s idea on spread democraci and american intervention amp x B now thi argument is just a realli bad one the video seem to make the point that wilson s biggest mistak wa start the legaci of wilsonian intervension america wa alreadi an interventionist power well befor wilson such as establish trade relat in asia expand imperi in the phillipin the pacif and carribean and engag in local affair in latin america the main differ with wilson s ideolog wa that he want to interven and stay in the name of spread american democraci around the world and not just for busi or territori gain not that thi alway work out perfectli He argu at versail for nation determin and wa vehement against strictli punish germani for the war oppos what franc want the failur to listen to wilson creat a shitti hybrid compromis where germani wa punshi enough to instil nationalist zeal and hatr but not enough to prevent german rearmament although grant the unwilling of the alli to resist hitler until it wa too late also didn t help that and the eventu republican withdraw from the leagu of nation wa veri much a signific contributor to the downward spiral that led to the second world war the video also seem to argu that if we had follow roosevelt s big stick diplomaci or the get in get out approach the U S would ve been better off use the gulf war as an exampl thi again doesn t invalid the wilsonian approach howev while the big stick method work well in a situat like the gulf war where the goal wasn t to spread democraci but to prevent iraq from threaten it It would ve fail in other conflict the wilsonian approach work well in europ and japan follow WW as well as korea sinc it wa crucial that the U S remain in those nation to insur that democraci would take hold so that they do not succumb to communist influenc and remain alli amp x B We are veri much blind by our interventionist failur in vietnam the middl east and africa to see what good american intervent ha brought to the world those failur were not brought on by the wilsonian apporach but by the fact that no proper apporach wa use at all either way for everi failur of american intervent there are at least half a dozen success stori today of the planet s nation are democraci compar to less than a quarter at the time of wilson most of these democraci are alli to the U S and nowher in the world are there major conflict go on becaus of thi We live in the most peac time there have ever been and the averag human s level of wealth and freedom is at it s peak thi is undeni a result of american influenc and a lot of it stem from wilson and hi point howev flaw a man he wa amp x B To conclud I know thi is mayb not the best written essay but I m not exactli an experienc writer I m just tri to convey my thought and feel about alternatehistoryhub s video It just seem unfair that wilson is take so much shit in the video and is talk about like he s the devil himself Of cours he wa still an extrem flaw figur and hi view on racism are rather disgust and leav much to be desir that doesn t mean that he wa a horribl person and it frankli is childish

1462,Greatest historical figure during Jesus' adult life,1,"Greatest historical figure during Jesus' adult lifeWho was by antiquity's standards the most outstanding human being during the adult life of Jesus Christ? In retrospective, Jesus is the most influential human being in history, but during his own lifetime, he was the founder of a relatively small religious group. Men of science probably weren't  as unanimously revered as now days, and it wasn't a time of great discoveries either way. So it was most likely a ruler/military leader.

Let's say between the deaths of brave millitary leader **Arminius&amp;Germanicus**(19-21AD for the former) and the rise of **Emperor Guangwu of Han**(ascended to the throne in 25AD so probably a few years till he gained respect of his poeple).

\-The Roman Emperor was **Tiberius**, and while he was successful as a general, he was rated as a poor Emperor after the death of his son.

\-there are 2 contemporary **Chinese emperors** during this time(so not enough to fill the gap) and the latter was an incompetent ruler

\-**Sejanus** was arguably the most influential man in the Roman Empire for a while, but he was as unsavory as Tiberius

\-The Parthian king **Artabanus** was a cruel king and there's hardly anything outstanding about him.

\-In India, the **Kushan king** was relatively average.

&amp;#x200B;

So all the usual suspects are essentially cut out. The best I could find was the Dacian ruler,  **Comosicus** .

*Jordanes refers to* [*Burebista*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burebista) *as king of* [*Dacia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia)*, but then goes on to discuss a high priest called* [*Dicineus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicineus) *who taught the Dacians astronomy and whose wisdom was revered. He then says that ""after the death of Dicienus, they held Comosicus in almost equal honour, because he was not inferior in knowledge. By reason of his wisdom he was accounted their priest and king, and he judged the people with the greatest uprightness.""*  Sounds like the most intelligent monarch of his age.

1463,"How come between the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Viking Era, Western European realms stayed very small?",1,"How come between the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Viking Era, Western European realms stayed very small?I've noticed that:

* When the Roman Empire was around, an extremely large state was able to exist
* After the Western Roman Empire fell, Western European realms fractured into small chiefdoms (the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate are a different story)
* As Feudalism rose in the 700s, large realms started to exist again (e.g. Holy Roman Empire), and small chiefdoms elsewhere started to coalesce into larger nations (e.g. the Heptarchy)
* By the 900s, somewhat large states existed again, such as England, Norway, Denmark, France, Castile, Leon, Galicia, Hungary, Poland and the Kievan Rus.

This inspires to ask the following questions:

* Why were the Romans able to run an extremely large state, but the Western Europeans couldn't until the Age of Colonialism? Did Western Europe somehow lose knowledge on running extremely large states?
* What made it so that Western Europeans were stuck in tiny chiefdoms when the Western Roman Empire fell? Why didn't Western Roman Empire collapse into Francia, Italia, Hispania and Britannia?

1465,"What are some historical examples of 'If one thing goes wrong with our plan, we're doomed!'",1,"What are some historical examples of 'If one thing goes wrong with our plan, we're doomed!'One that springs to mind for me, was Operation Mincemeat in WWII. Such a risky, crazy mission to float the dead body of a vagrant named Glyndwr Michael onto Spanish shores disguised as a high ranking British officer named Captain (Acting Major) William Martin in the hope that the body finds its way to the shore intact, carrying 'British secret plans for Invasion of Sardinia and Greece'. And is somehow found by a high ranking German officer...

So much could have gone wrong. The body was already beginning to decay when thrown into the water. 

The tides were uncertain. 

The autopsy would almost certainly have revealed the corpse being older than was needed to provide the bluff, thankfully an insider at the autopsy tried to hide this by saying something along the lines of, ""let's just hurry this and go get lunch, it's too hot"". So the autopsy was ruled as drowning, which furthered the bluff (rather than eating rat poison, which is how Glyndwr Michael actually died).

On top of all of this was some serious back and forth bluffs and double bluffs via spies, deliberately crackable and breakable messages.

Major Martin's 'death at sea via planecrash' was even reported by The Times, and coincidentally his death was placed amidst two other (real) Officers who had died at sea, further enhancing the bluff.

Somehow against all odds, it worked. Hitler was convinced and changed his tactics. Shuffled and rotated his military hardware and troops accordingly.

--

On an amusing note, I remember fondly reading about something that happened in Africa(?) not too long after the deception had been revealed as a bluff and D-Day occurred.

I think I remember reading about some British Officer somehow accidentally leaving some extremely important documents, which were then obtained by a high ranking German Officer. However this time, those offensive plans were considered bluffs and thus the Germans refused to be 'fooled' twice, and ignored the documents as nothing more than lies.

Almost a reverse Operation Mincemeat.

Natural development of settlements in Medieval Europe was something like this:

3. Town reaches even further significance and is granted a city charter (meaning they city council is set up and they are given right to build walls around the city), thus becoming a city

While the opposite is article developments; this is how Helsinki, got started:

1. The King renamed a coastal village
2. The King relocated several bourgeois into the village
3. The King granted the settlement a marker right

Apart from the North not wanting the South states to secede, the desire to end slavery in the South is often stated as the major reason.

Also, yes, I know that there was a difference in economic sources of wealth between North and South: North was industrialized, while the South was agrarian. However, it doesn't answer the question why would the North oppose slavery. Why oppose it, if you can make slaves work on factories? Didn't the North have to recruit Europeans to make up for work force deficit? Why wouldn't business/factory owners want some free labor? After all, they didn't mind opposing unions and paing their workers very little, so they would hardly care about being humanists.

Of course, I understand that slavery is morally wrong and all that. However many things are morally wrong and still exist.

1510,What historical periods and geographical eras were defined by close proximity and constant conflict or tensions between multiple independent nation-states?,1,"What historical periods and geographical eras were defined by close proximity and constant conflict or tensions between multiple independent nation-states?Tl;Dr: Basically the title. Periods in history with several nation-states in close proximity that were in competition while being relatively equally matched (no empires or hegemons).

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone, I'm a political scientist working on some research, and I thought I'd reach out to Reddit's historian community because I'm not always as versed in history as I should be. Furthermore my field of study emphasizes certain eras and government systems which can blind me to some more niche areas of history. Btw please inform me if this question does not meet the rules of the subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for any era and place in history where the international relations of the region are marked by multiple very close (preferably territorial tangent) nation-states that are in constant competition, either in the form of war or a general balance of power arrangement (which can include economic competition).

&amp;#x200B;

By ""nation"" and ""state"" I am using the political science definitions, which are probably basically the same for historians.

&amp;#x200B;

By ""state"" I mean a ""a political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly by use of force within a certain geographical territory."" More specifically it is the institutions and machinery of governance; a centralized system of government with a clear authority (monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, etc) that can determine policy (from multiple different options) for the state as a whole, and some form of system beneath that deciding body (often in the form of a bureaucracy) that can implement those policies in some form. In addition some form of regularized military is also required for the definition I am using.

&amp;#x200B;

By ""nation"" I mean ""a distinct population of people that are bound together by a common culture, history, and tradition who are typically concentrated within a specific geographic region.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I am looking for periods where there are multiple nation-states (not one nation that has collapsed into many separate states that still share a roughly identical culture and who eventual reform into one nation) in close proximity and in constant tension or outright conflict. In addition, they should be of roughly equal strength - I am not looking for a vast empire surrounded by smaller tributary polities (like ancient China and most of the nearby nations, or the Roman Empire). The various nation-states must be able to compete with each other effectively, without being dominated by one giant hegemon.

&amp;#x200B;

One example might be western Europe for a lot of its post-Roman history, especially starting around the time of religious wars through the peace of Westphalia, leading into the age of colonization and all the way until the end of the world wars. Another might be ancient Greece and the competition by the various unique city-states such as Athens and Sparta (they don't need to be countries by the modern definition, but rather unique polities with both a state and a nation).

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. I'm looking for other examples of this situation. Colleagues have suggested the Balkans or parts of India as examples, without much context. Do you, the historians of reddit, know of any other such historical periods?


Edit:
I realize that my definition was way too vague to be useful. As I mentioned in the comments, ""it doesn't mean they have to all be entirely separate cultures with no crossover in culture or history. They can be similar, or share a historical past together. What I am looking for in particular though is that they do not internally identify themselves as part of a greater whole with their competing neighbors, such as the various ""Germanic"" nations that considered themselves to be related. I'm looking for full competition with the goal being unrelated to any potential cultural ties that might dampen the intensity of that competition and unmoored from any desires to merge to a larger conglomeration due to the perception that they are parts of a whole.""",1,what histor period and geograph era were defin by close proxim and constant conflict or tension between multipl independ nation state,what histor period and geograph era were defin by close proxim and constant conflict or tension between multipl independ nation state Tl Dr basic the titl period in histori with sever nation state in close proxim that were in competit while be rel equal match no empir or hegemon amp x B hey everyon I m a polit scientist work on some research and I thought I d reach out to reddit s historian commun becaus I m not alway as vers in histori as I should be furthermor my field of studi emphas certain era and govern system which can blind me to some more nich area of histori btw pleas inform me if thi question doe not meet the rule of the subreddit amp x B I m look for ani era and place in histori where the intern relat of the region are mark by multipl veri close prefer territori tangent nation state that are in constant competit either in the form of war or a gener balanc of power arrang which can includ econom competit amp x B By nation and state I am use the polit scienc definit which are probabl basic the same for historian amp x B By state I mean a a polit organ with a central govern that maintain a monopoli by use of forc within a certain geograph territori more specif it is the institut and machineri of govern a central system of govern with a clear author monarchi oligarchi democraci etc that can determin polici from multipl differ option for the state as a whole and some form of system beneath that decid bodi often in the form of a bureaucraci that can implement those polici in some form In addit some form of regular militari is also requir for the definit I am use amp x B By nation I mean a distinct popul of peopl that are bound togeth by a common cultur histori and tradit who are typic concentr within a specif geograph region amp x B So I am look for period where there are multipl nation state not one nation that ha collaps into mani separ state that still share a roughli ident cultur and who eventu reform into one nation in close proxim and in constant tension or outright conflict In addit they should be of roughli equal strength I am not look for a vast empir surround by smaller tributari politi like ancient china and most of the nearbi nation or the roman empir the variou nation state must be abl to compet with each other effect without be domin by one giant hegemon amp x B one exampl might be western europ for a lot of it post roman histori especi start around the time of religi war through the peac of westphalia lead into the age of colon and all the way until the end of the world war anoth might be ancient greec and the competit by the variou uniqu citi state such as athen and sparta they don t need to be countri by the modern definit but rather uniqu politi with both a state and a nation amp x B sorri for the long post I m look for other exampl of thi situat colleagu have suggest the balkan or part of india as exampl without much context Do you the historian of reddit know of ani other such histor period edit I realiz that my definit wa way too vagu to be use As I mention in the comment it doesn t mean they have to all be entir separ cultur with no crossov in cultur or histori they can be similar or share a histor past togeth what I am look for in particular though is that they do not intern identifi themselv as part of a greater whole with their compet neighbor such as the variou german nation that consid themselv to be relat I m look for full competit with the goal be unrel to ani potenti cultur tie that might dampen the intens of that competit and unmoor from ani desir to merg to a larger conglomer due to the percept that they are part of a whole

My maternal family had to literally leave everything behind and return to the country with virtually nothing alongside another million people. The blame has been placed on Mario Soares (ex-president of the Portuguese Republic), who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time negotiations were taking place in order to have a smooth transition of giving independence to Portuguese colonies (that man in general however was a horrible human being, there is strong evidence of his corrupt doings while in public office)

1552,"The Tito‚ÄìStalin split, the Moscow Conference, and how they influenced the outcome of Greek Civil War discussion.",1,"The Tito‚ÄìStalin split, the Moscow Conference, and how they influenced the outcome of Greek Civil War discussion.The Greek Civil War is considered by many historians the first cold war proxy war. 

Fighting was between the [Democratic Army of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Army_of_Greece) (**DSE**) which was the military branch of the [Communist Party of Greece (KKE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Greece), supported by neighboring newly founded Socialist States of Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria, and the [Greek government army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Army) ‚Äî backed by the United Kingdom and the United States. 

The war lasted until 1949 and was ultimately won by the government army, while the remaining forces of DSE had to leave the country. The defeat of the soviet-backed communist forces was presented as a victory of the West versus the East. In this narrative US and British support saved Greece from communism. 

The problem with this narrative is that in the Moscow Conference (October 1944) Stalin and Churchill agreed (the Percentages Agreement) that Greece would belong to the British sphere of influence. This was one of the matters that caused friction between Tito and Stalin since Tito was openly supportive of the communist side in the [Greek Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War), while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with [Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) not to support communism there with the [Percentages agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentages_agreement). 

Apparently Tito supported the Greek communists as part of a greater plan to incorporate Albania and parts of Greece in cooperation with [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria), thereby creating a large Balkan Slavic communist state outside of Moscow's control. 

Apparently Stalin did not see Tito's ambitions in a positive light.

The friction culminated in 1948 when Stalin stated his unqualified opposition to the ""Greek uprising"". Stalin explained to the Yugoslav delegation that the situation in Greece was different from the one in Yugoslavia because the US and Britain would ""never permit \[Greece\] to break off their lines of communication in the Mediterranean"". (Stalin used the word *svernut*, Russian for ""fold up"", to express what the Greek Communists should do.)

The Tito‚ÄìStalin split directly influenced the military outcome of the Greek Civil War since the DSE used bases and camps in Yugoslavia and was dependent on supplies and equipment from Yugoslavia, plus the advantage of being able to retreat across the border in order to regroup and resupply in areas where the government army could not pursue.  

Since Yugoslavia had been the Greek Communists' main supporter, the KKE was forced to choose between its loyalty to the Soviet Union and its relations with its closest ally. After much internal conflict, the great majority, led by party secretary [Nikolaos Zachariadis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaos_Zachariadis), chose to follow the Soviet Union. 

 With that decision the leaders of KKE essentially doomed their cause since they sided with Stalin who was never supportive of their cause against Tito who was the main supporter of their cause.   In response to the above decision Tito closed the Yugoslav border to the DSE in July 1949 and disbanded the camps inside Yugoslavia. The DSE was only able to use Albanian border territories, a very poor alternative. Within the Greek Communist Party, the split with Tito also sparked a witch hunt for ""Titoites"" that demoralized and disorganized the ranks of the DSE and sapped support for the KKE in urban areas.

 In August 1949, the government army launched a major offensive against DSE forces in northern Greece, codenamed ""Operation Torch"". The campaign was a victory for the government army and resulted in heavy losses for the DSE. The DSE army was thus no longer able to sustain resistance in pitched battles.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)

Also I might be wrong but in the Peninsular war the Spanish Juntas seemed to be doing the same thing to determine who was in charge. Did the Spanish just see that this is how the French Directory was running things and if it was good enough for them then it is good enough for us?

1567,Why did none of the Greek city-states imitate Spartan tactics during its height,1,"Why did none of the Greek city-states imitate Spartan tactics during its heightThe Spartans are known for being feared warriors and having a dominant land army. While some of the reputation about the Spartans is exaggerated by writers, it is undeniable that the Spartan military was successful in various engagements and feared by its fellow city-states, both allied and enemy.

Why did the other Greek city states not adopt Spartan tactics/military strategies? Sparta went undefeated in pitched battle for 150 years. Athens and its allies were also fighting on and off with them for over 50 years. They certainly had strong and shrewd leaders like Pericles over the years. Surely one or two leaders prior to 371 would have realize that Sparta was probably doing something different from them that resulted in these victories. Were they unable to due to circumstances in their societies and governments?

**Edit**: To clarify, I'm not referring to adopting their culture. Rather I'm referring to the organizational of the Spartan army, such as formation drill and subdivisions in their army making it more flexible than its neighbors. Since they played such a major role in maintaining their dominance on land, why did nobody adopt them during their height?",1,whi did none of the greek citi state imit spartan tactic dure it height,whi did none of the greek citi state imit spartan tactic dure it heightth spartan are known for be fear warrior and have a domin land armi while some of the reput about the spartan is exagger by writer it is undeni that the spartan militari wa success in variou engag and fear by it fellow citi state both alli and enemi whi did the other greek citi state not adopt spartan tactic militari strategi sparta went undef in pitch battl for year athen and it alli were also fight on and off with them for over year they certainli had strong and shrewd leader like pericl over the year sure one or two leader prior to would have realiz that sparta wa probabl do someth differ from them that result in these victori were they unabl to due to circumst in their societi and govern edit To clarifi I m not refer to adopt their cultur rather I m refer to the organiz of the spartan armi such as format drill and subdivis in their armi make it more flexibl than it neighbor sinc they play such a major role in maintain their domin on land whi did nobodi adopt them dure their height

Among them:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Car manufacturers BMW and Volkswagen, obviously supplied vehicles or vehicle parts

\- Pharma giant Bayer, arguably the worst supplier because they produced the chemicals which were used in the holocaust (but also basic material used in machinery production)

\- Engineering giant Bosch, manufactured various parts for almost the entire war machinery (it is said that there was not a single German tank that didn't have a Bosch part in it)

\- Steel manufacturer Krupp, produced weaponry

\- Fashion brand Hugo Boss, designed and equipped military uniforms, among them the SS

&amp;#x200B;

Not only did they heavily support the military prowess of Germany, but almost all of them had forced labourers (among them prisoners of war) working for them.

&amp;#x200B;

After the war ended, did the allies in any way punish those companies or demand compensation in any form?

Or did said companies just go on with their regular business after the war ended?

I am sure that most of these companies didn't have a choice, they couldn't just say ""no"" to Hitler, but still, my question remains.

This subreddit apparently has a minimum character limit for self posts, so to fulfill that requirement, here's some basic info about Villon.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

""Mais o√π sont les neiges d'antan?"" 

This is the most famous and well known quote from [Fran√ßois Villon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran√ßois_Villon#Biography), a medieval French poet known as much for his roguish exploits as for his poetry. 

Born in 1431 as either Fran√ßois de Montcorbier or Fran√ßois de Loges, he studied at the University of Paris as a young man. Later, in 1455, he was banished for fatally stabbing a priest to death in a street fight. (Allegedly, the priest started it.)

Later on, after a stay in prison, he stabbed another person in another street fight. He was banished again. Not much is known of his life after this second incident.

His poetry reflects his involvement in the ""criminal underworld"" of fifteenth century Paris, incorporating contemporary thieves' slang and other linguistic features that went against the grain of the usual courtly ideals of the time.

He wanted to know my ideas on a fairly obscure topic of boats and river travel on the Ohio, Mississippi... in the early 1800s. He can find lots of material on how flat bottom boats were built and sailed down the rivers. But no material on how water was kept out of the boats. He suspected that some sort of pump may have been used or were they bailed by hand (probably almost continuously). If they were pumped how was the pump constructed in the wilderness? Leather was probably used for the piston end, so did people have enough metal on hand for the pump body, or was a branch hollowed out and used? If not pumping then were the boats eventually made water tight enough so that only occasional builging was required? Were assuming that wood buckets were used to bail water out of the boats.

 There are multiple references to ""leather pumps"" as part of a flatboats equipment list in a number of journals written in the late 18th century. These journals stress that most flatboats were built by frontier farmers without access to milled lumber or nails. No metal was used. Pumps of some sort were homemade too, with a leather cup on the plunger. There are plans galore for flatboat construction but nothing to be found on the pumps.  

A huge percentage of farmers built flatboats yearly, floated them to Natchez or New Orleans, sold their crops, and then walked home via the Natchez Trace, until steam boats came on the scene (1811). The boats would be disassembled and sold as lumber‚Ä¶or broken up for firewood. After steamboats, the flatboats would be loaded with firewood (for the steamboat) and towed back upstream.

The reason being that the Soviets did not yet have nuclear weapons and were forced to withdraw their troops from South Azerbaijan. 

Thereafter Stalin signed an agreement with Iran for oil, only to lose that deal too as the shah refused to sign a further oil pact with Stalin after he had occupied Iranian territory in S. Azerbaijan.

So the USSR really lost this Crisis twice.

You would think that historians, who are mainly American or NATO linked, would like to gloat about this.

Yet often the story of the Cold War skips straight to the more dramatic European standoff.  This kind of seems paradoxical as US history is full of playing up minor victories

1599,Why are the post-WW2 attitudes of Germany and Japan so different?,1,"Why are the post-WW2 attitudes of Germany and Japan so different?I spent a solid afternoon wikipedia'ng the Surrender of Japan and despite it being interesting reading and providing a very different view of its surrender compared to what I had thought, it also made me think of the differences between the WW2 surrender and post war years of Germany and Japan.

Germany had the whole Nazi party basically ripped out and removed and extensive de-Nazification continued until today, with even the image of Hitler being banned. Germany as a nation is often publically and vocally apologetic about the Holocaust, its role in the deaths of millions and how awful the Nazi ruling party was. Its extensively taught in schools, concentration camps (the few there were in Germany main) are open as museums. (I'm going to gloss over the fact that many members of the Nazi party were left in power both to aid the transition to democracy, provide a bastion vs the USSR and help the allied war/ space efforts).

Compare this to Japan. The ruling party was not removed, the ruling members were replaced or killed themselves, but the Emperor was left untouched. The imperial household never admitted any guilt in the war or the extensive war crimes and of course none of its members were ever charged with war crimes (from what i could see). Hirohito's surrender speech is actually pretty incredible to read. It gives no admission of having ever done anything wrong, blames the allies for the war and its invasion of SEA and claims its surrender is due to purely philanthropic reasons. I know this is a speech of propaganda, but if you examine the history of Japan since, its very consistent with the minimization, ignoring or down-right suppression of its actions in WW2.

I don't think many would be surprised to learn that Japan's actions during WW2 were as, if not more, evil than Germany's. Yet I have seen multiple modern examples of the Japanese government trying to minimise its war crimes, for instance it rejected the fact that there was such a thing as ""Comfort Women"" in Korea, instead saying the basic enslavement of all Korean women to be **used** by its soldiers as them willingly choosing a life of prostitution: [Comfort women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women#cite_note-148). Then theres the [rewriting of Japanese school textbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_history_textbook_controversies) to censor war crimes, the invasion of China and the Japanese armies role in forcing the mass suicides of the citizen population of Okinawa.

I‚Äôm interested in 18th century Scotland, especially the early-middle 1700s, for a project. Not just the Jacobite uprisings,but general day to day life, (especially in the highlands before that way of life was nearly wiped out.)

Economy, village structure, gender roles, clan structure, religion, the foreign wars Scottish mercs fought in, etc.

As far as the war is concerned, especially the 45, I‚Äôm more interested in how the lives of those who stayed behind went and the internal politics of the different clan loyalties. Spies and English loyalist/Jacobite infighting is interesting but I want to know about the lives of those who remained neutral before and during the wars.

I prefer audiobooks to physical ones. Thanks.

As slaves they were bred for strength and endurance so you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be better fighters. If you supported them they should have the same right to fight for their country as anyone.

1621,Are horse archers overrated?,1,"Are horse archers overrated?It seems to me that far too much significance is placed upon the use of horse archers by varying nomadic tribes, especially when compared to shock and cataphract cavalry. To clarify, I do not believe that horse archers were what won battles, and were nowhere near as effective as an organised heavy cavalry unit. A good starting example would be the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC compared to the Romans' wars with the Alans in the 2nd Century. At Carrhae, a combined a combined force of Horse archers **and Cataphracts** were able to rout a larger Roman army. The Horse archers' role in that battle started and ended at harassing the Romans to get them to loosen formations and then allowing the Cataphracts to charge. The Romans could have easily countered the Iranians using a large force of foot archers, who would have been able to repulse the horse archers. That is precisely what Arrian said he did during his wars with the Alans, who had used almost exclusively horse archers, and beat them. Even the Mongols, who are always hailed as having perfected the horse archer, had dedicated at least a third of their force as cataphracts. During Charlemagne's wars, he too was able to achieve massive success against the Avars using his army that primarily consisted of heavy cavalry.  And, as my final example, the battle of Lechfield, where Otto The Great's army, that, again, primarily consisted of  mailed knights, who, aside from a minor skirmish at the Germans' supply train, were able to rout a Hungarian force of primarily horse archers.",1,are hors archer overr,are hors archer overr It seem to me that far too much signific is place upon the use of hors archer by vari nomad tribe especi when compar to shock and cataphract cavalri To clarifi I do not believ that hors archer were what won battl and were nowher near as effect as an organis heavi cavalri unit A good start exampl would be the battl of carrha in BC compar to the roman war with the alan in the nd centuri At carrha a combin a combin forc of hors archer and cataphract were abl to rout a larger roman armi the hors archer role in that battl start and end at harass the roman to get them to loosen format and then allow the cataphract to charg the roman could have easili counter the iranian use a larg forc of foot archer who would have been abl to repuls the hors archer that is precis what arrian said he did dure hi war with the alan who had use almost exclus hors archer and beat them even the mongol who are alway hail as have perfect the hors archer had dedic at least a third of their forc as cataphract dure charlemagn s war he too wa abl to achiev massiv success against the avar use hi armi that primarili consist of heavi cavalri and as my final exampl the battl of lechfield where otto the great s armi that again primarili consist of mail knight who asid from a minor skirmish at the german suppli train were abl to rout a hungarian forc of primarili hors archer

FINAL ISSUE


S S PAINE WINGATE IS EXPECTED TO DOCK AT NEW YORK PIER ABOUT NOON TOMORROW, COMPLETING 19-DAY VOYAGE FROM MARSEILLE; WEATHER REPORTS NOT FAVORABLE


Dressed in olive drab, complete with overcoats and overseas caps, personnel of the 310th Field Artillery Battalion will walk down the gangplank in New York harbor tomorrow afternoon, thus completing a 19-day trip from Marseille, France, to the United States.

Latest estimates were that the SS Paine Wingate will reach Ambrose Light, outside of New York harbor, at 1000 tomorrow and there will pick up a pilot for the movement into the pier, which is unknown at this time.The trip from Ambrose Light to the pier is expected to take about two hours.

The prognosis on weather indicates a rough voyage from here to the harbor, but not rough enough to seriously impede the progress of the ship. Mileage figures could not be obtained today.

The uniform for debarkation will be wool OD, with combat boots or leggins, overseas caps, overcoats. Ties or blouses are not necessary.

After the Paine Wingate passes Ambrose Light, all duffel bags will be placed on deck in places to be designated. The personnel of the ship will debark in passenger list order--the same which was used for embarkation at Marseille.

After the baggage has been placed on deck, the holds will be policed thoroughly--the bottom bunks being raised to facilitate the cleaning. No equipment will be left behind.

When the Paine Wingate docks, there will be no smoking on the ship or on the pier. No one will go aft of Hold 5, or forward of Hold 1.

PIPELINE PRESS GOES OUT OF BUSINESS; PLACED ON AUCTION BLOCK at 2000 TODAY; NEW YORK CORRESPONDENT‚ÄôS LIST MESSAGE PRINTED ON THIS ISSUE


	


For Sale:
2 battered typewriters; one slightly used mimeograph machine; full rights to the name ‚ÄúTHE PIPELINE PRESS‚Äù.
	
There comes a time in every newspaper‚Äôs life when it is necessary to discuss the background--for the amusement of the readers and to find something to fill a lot of white space.

Owner, publisher and general manager was Lt. Arthur Charpentier who quickly doubled the staff by adding Sgt Bill Evans to the ‚Äúpayroll‚Äù under the title ‚Äúeditor‚Äù. The mechanical staff was headed by Sgt Dan Zarnick who cut as many stencils aboard the Paine Wingate as he did with XII Corps.

In its brief but glorious history, THE PIPELINE PRESS had many difficulties--the first was the shortage of stencils which was eliminated after the second day and issues started coming daily. Then there was an ink shortage and the paper went back to an ‚Äúevery other day‚Äù schedule--until recently. 

The rest of the staff comprised Tim Gibbons, photographer, whose picture of Bermuda is not published as he pushed off on a second inner tube to get photos of the 310th landing in New York, and our New York correspondent who went with the first advance party. He is G.I. HADIT, of Buffalo. Some of our news as you know was radioed to us from New York by Hadit. It was necessary to decode it as he endeavored to save as many words as possible. To give you a little more about the inside workings of a newspaper, today we print his dispatch from New York in its raw form: PIPELINE PRESS S S PAINE WINGATE ATLANTIC OCEAN ATLANTIC OCEAN STOP COLD SELL HE IN NY STOP CHECKED WITH WAR DEPARTMENT AND LEARNED MEN ABOARD WINGATE MAY GO TO SWANSON(?) OR GREAT LAKES AS THEY NOW ARE ELIGIBLE FOR NAVAL DISCHARGE ALSO STOP LEARNED S S DICKINSON DOCKED HERE TWO WEEKS AGO WITH PERSONNEL WITH POINTS HANGING FROM 21 THROUGH 23 STOP ALL SINCE DISCHARGED STOP RECEIVED MY DISCHARGE WAITING FOR SHIP TO DOCK STOP SOLD CAMERA TO FIVE POINTER ETO BOUND STOP LEAVING FOR BUFFALO TONIGHT ON DOG SLED STOP MERRY CHRISTMAS STOP

Therefore, THE PIPELINE PRESS goes on auction at 2000 today in Hold 1. The auctioneer will be the captain of the head.

310TH TO DOCK AS US SUFFERS FROM WORST COLD SPELL OF WINTER; BUFFALO BURIED UNDER ALMOST FOUR FOOT OF SNOW; MERCURY BELOW ZERO AS FAR SOUTH AS FLORIDA

The United States is in the grip of a terrific cold spell today. Temperatures generally were below normal in a wide area east of the Rockies. The mercury fell below zero in Montana, and the Dakotas eastward through Central Illinois and Indiana. The coldest spot last midnight was Glascow, Montana, where it was 20 below. It‚Äôs freezing as far south as the northern end of the Florida Peninsula and along the Gulf Coast of Southern Mississippi. A blizzard from Lake Erie deposited up to 38 inches of snow on Buffalo causing a state of emergency. In sunny Florida, the thermometer has nose dived to 32 degrees, while Providence, Rhode Island is shivering in an 11 degree above zero temperature. Billing(s), Montana--traditionally a cold spot--is really shivering with the temperature down to 20 degrees below zero and still dropping. The following weather forecast picked up this morning by the ship‚Äôs radio from New York is published in its entirety:




MONDAY DEC 17 - NEW YORK CITY WEATHER FORECAST - 0730 TEMPERATURE 13 DEGREES - WIND 13 MILES PER HOUR - HIGHEST TEMPERATURE IN NEW YORK CITY TODAY 20 DEGREES - TONIGHT 10 DEGREES IN CITY 5 DEGREES IN SUBURBS - TUESDAY TEMPERATURE ABOUT THE SAME BUT NOT QUITE SO WINDY.
	
The AP reports from Washington that the Pearl Harbor investigation is in the midst of a political flare-up. With today‚Äôs session, Rep. Keefe(?) demanded to know whether the Senate House Committee is investigating Pearl Harbor or Governor Dewey. Keefe is referring to previous testimony that General George C. Marshall appealed to Governor Dewey to quiet talk about Pearl Harbor during the 1944 presidential campaign. Another controversy aroused today when Senator Brewster read into the record a statement by Percy L. Reaves, in which he stated that he never intended to insult or reflect in any way on members of the committee. Reaves is a former employee of the Republican National Committee. His presence at the inquiry has evoked caustic remarks from Democratic members.

Meanwhile the red hot controversy over the proposed Army-Navy merger continues before the Senate Military Affairs Committee. After a long series of Navy arguments against unification, General Somerville; head of the ASF, took the stand to give further arguments for the union.

The Army‚Äôs new 430 MPH bomber, the Mix Master, which recently set a new coast to coast record, crashed yesterday while on a routine forty minute flight. It was completely demolished. According to the pilot, who bailed out at 400 feet and was considerably shaken by his experience, the motors quit instantly while flying.

Talks started in Moscow between Secretary of State Byrnes, Foreign Minister of Great Britain Bevin, and Foreign Commisar Molotov of Russia. An ‚Äúatmosphere of cordiality‚Äù, unlike the London conference which ended in complete failure, was said to prevail.

ARE WE REALLY GETTING THERE? You bet your life we are. The latest hot dope puts us into New York about noon tomorrow. More convincing than reports, however, was a session we had this morning with a small portable broadcast set Frank Connely, chief radio operator aboard, has in his room. A twirl of the dial produced a honeyed voiced announcer in Providence telling us we ought to swab our chest with Rusteroic(?) to get rid of any damn thing that ails us. A gent in New York promised us eternal youth if we would munch a bushel or two of some breakfast food or other. On short wave, we heard a cop in the big city tell a prowl car to proceed quietly to an apartment uptown to look into some shenanigans there. And then there was the Joe in Boston who was practically in tears because we didn‚Äôt have an exide battery in every car. This could only be the United States coming in on the beam(?) but strong. Yes, we‚Äôre getting there.

This is the last issue of the PIPELINE PRESS--for which ‚Äúleave us all give thanks‚Äù. In bowing out--or beating a hasty retreat, depending on your point of view--we owe a big vote of thanks to the ship‚Äôs master, Capt. L. L. Beasley, for the cooperation he has given us throughout the voyage. We have bothered him about mileage, barged into his chart room, tramped his bridge, asked seven million questions, and never once have received the bum‚Äôs rush to which we were entitled. Many thanks also to the ship‚Äôs radio gang, Frank Connely, Ronnie Kayerson, and George Mahoney for their help in getting us the news. This last got to the point where they would copy anything interesting that came over, if we didn‚Äôt happen to be around at the time. Lt. Wheeler, the official Transportation Corps representative aboard, has given us a great deal of assistance, aided and abetted by his T/3 commando, whose name escapes us for the moment. And so, with the sound of a Christmas Carol in our ears coming over the radio, the PIPELINE PRESS wishes all those friends of ours a Merry Christmas in that most delightful of all our places -- home.

With town walls especially in smaller towns (like Rothenburg, to name one of the more famous examples) being much less sophisticated than those on proper castles, I'm wondering if those fortifications were actually useful against determined military threats or if they were mostly used to keep out troublemakers, sick people and beggars? 

What would point towards a military use is that most town walls do feature loopholes to fire arrows or crossbows through, but as I said before, town walls also seem (naturally, considering their much greater length) to be much less massive and layered than what one would see at actual castles. 

So, I guess the truth is somewhere in the middle, but maybe some of the experts on here know a bit more, e.g. about concrete examples of medieval towns and cities resisting against significant armies.",1,militari signific of mediev town wall,militari signific of mediev town wall one for the expert on militari histori on here with town wall especi in smaller town like rothenburg to name one of the more famou exampl be much less sophist than those on proper castl I m wonder if those fortif were actual use against determin militari threat or if they were mostli use to keep out troublemak sick peopl and beggar what would point toward a militari use is that most town wall do featur loophol to fire arrow or crossbow through but as I said befor town wall also seem natur consid their much greater length to be much less massiv and layer than what one would see at actual castl So I guess the truth is somewher in the middl but mayb some of the expert on here know a bit more e g about concret exampl of mediev town and citi resist against signific armi

Both of my parents are history professors with multiple PhDs, but I always thought history was boring and dull and full of people making mistakes. 
Until now! I realized that I am more and more passionate about the Romans, especially Republic to Empire time period, so I‚Äôve been reading a lot on it and it‚Äôs quite interesting.

So a question I can‚Äôt seem to answer is: why is it that the Roman Empire did not expand any further into Africa? I know that they went North and East as much as they could? But why not South? 
I realize that the Saharan desert was a big impediment - but was nobody curious about going up the Nile further into the continent and conquer the tribes?

As such, I would love more than anything to get in contact and meet with anyone who knew or has met Stalin, even if just briefly, both for outstanding material for my master's thesis and also to fulfill a deep personal interest.

From seeing historical footage (and movies, and so on) I have a pretty good idea of what American ""Doughboys"" looked like in World War One, and I think I would be hard pressed to find anyone that doesn't recognize the typical American soldier in WWII. However, I'm not really sure what the American military looked like, especially during the Great Depression. A couple of days ago I watched a documentary for my history class that covered the years from 1929 to 1936 and I noticed a couple of seconds of footage depicting American soldiers and what I swear was a FT-17 Light Tank (my Battlefield 1 experiences don't lie). However, beyond a couple of seconds of blurry black and white footage I couldn't really find anything, be it description or image. I'm a huge military history nerd so I'd totally appreciate any response!

**TL;DR** \- What changes, if any, did the American military see to its uniform/gear/weaponry/armored support after WWI but before the outbreak of WWII?

See, Hualarotlan was the central trading nation, since it's the last place with a port before the roads to the other landlocked countries with stuff to sell and buy. But the trade route goes along the Olisian coast before reaching Hualarotlan. Olisia decided to up its tariffs on goods travelling along its coast, which it can get away with because its coast is also regularly bombarded by hurricans, and Olisian ports are the best shelter for these ships. This coulda been debated and diplomats could have figured out a solution, but throw in some shady dealings and petty politicians and an assassination attempt, and it led to war.

So, how long would the Hualarotlan-Olisian war last? Most countries back Hualarotlan, but are either too far away to provide more than a military threat in Olisia's peripheral vision, or economic support. While Olisia is outnumbered, it is stronger than Hualarotlan, commanding more land, ergo more resources and soldiers, and a larger navy, though the hurricanes rule out any attempt at a siege of a port town.",1,how long do most trade war go,how long do most trade war go I m a writer and I m tri to find out how long a trade war between neighbor countri would go see hualarotlan wa the central trade nation sinc it s the last place with a port befor the road to the other landlock countri with stuff to sell and buy but the trade rout goe along the olisian coast befor reach hualarotlan olisia decid to up it tariff on good travel along it coast which it can get away with becaus it coast is also regularli bombard by hurrican and olisian port are the best shelter for these ship thi coulda been debat and diplomat could have figur out a solut but throw in some shadi deal and petti politician and an assassin attempt and it led to war So how long would the hualarotlan olisian war last most countri back hualarotlan but are either too far away to provid more than a militari threat in olisia s peripher vision or econom support while olisia is outnumb it is stronger than hualarotlan command more land ergo more resourc and soldier and a larger navi though the hurrican rule out ani attempt at a sieg of a port town

1672,"How exaggerated are Caesar's description of his legionaries' eagerness for battle, and has this ever been displayed in other instances?",1,"How exaggerated are Caesar's description of his legionaries' eagerness for battle, and has this ever been displayed in other instances?I'm reading Caesar's chronicles (I am just past Caesar's defeat at Gergovia), and one of the things that really stands out to me is how Caesar portrays his troops basically ""licking their lips"" for battle, and at times begging him to let them fight the enemy. It's also a common trope for the army to shame the legates if they weren't aggressively engaging the enemy. I know that Caesar's writings are undoubtedly influenced by propaganda, which is why I ask how overblown his claims were, but this also seems typical of Romans throughout the Republican period, and Rome's military successes speak for themselves, so I'm inclined to believe there's some veracity to what Caesar is saying. 

From what we know about ancient warfare, it may well have been one of the worst things humans experienced, especially at such a large scale. Nobody wants to Halloween-style hack anyone to death, and almost everybody should be terrified of being on the receiving end, and I've heard Dan Carlin describe situations were the teeth chattering in the ranks was the incredibly loud. Then we have Caesar describing his troops, when faced with a numerically superior enemy on a hill surrounded by a literal swamp at Avaricum, saying ""The soldiers were angry that the enemy was even allowed to tolerate the sight of their army at such close range and demanded the signal for battle. But Caesar explained to them what heavy losses they would suffer and how many brave men's deaths the victory would inevitably cost. When he saw them so determined to accept any and all risks in order to win him glory, he said, he would deserve to be judged guilty of the most terrible injustice if he did not a place a higher value on their lives than on his own welfare."" This isn't the best passage to describe what I'm talking about, but it's the closest to where I currently am.

Now the propaganda is obviously spread on pretty thick here, but these troops really seem to be of a different class than anything else in history. Sure we see them having trouble with soldiers ""ducking out"" at the Sabis when they were ambushed by the Nervii, but if Caesar had done what he should have and posted a couple legions in formation and on guard in case of such an event I don't think the battle would have even been a contest and morale would not have been an issue. Remember, with how the random battle line came together, many of these soldiers were separated from their units.

1702,How exactly did Bismarck‚Äôs supposed ‚Äúliberalisation‚Äù help him achieve his goals?,1,"How exactly did Bismarck‚Äôs supposed ‚Äúliberalisation‚Äù help him achieve his goals?Bismarck was a staunch conservative and a royalist. He made it clear on multiple occasions that his only real concern was furthering Prussian interests, and that he did not care at all about German Nationalism or its unification. He hated parliamentarianism, and all sorts of liberal/democratic policies.

Midway through his career, however, he realised that he needed the support of liberals and and started making concessions in their favour. He also began to view nationalism and the desire for unification favourably and realised he could use that sentiment to achieve his own goals (ie. strengthening Prussia). His political views changed so much that he upset his fellow conservatives who thought he was betraying their ideals. 

What exactly did all this do though? How did it help make ‚ÄúPrussia‚Äù stronger? The way he completely disregarded the Prussian parliament and went ahead with the reorganisation of the army without their consent, showed that he didn‚Äôt really _need_ to be popular with the liberals.

What I'm interested in is how their value held once the economic downturn was over. Intrinsically it is worth its weight in copper but it can't be used as currency, yet it holds greater value *now* because of novelty.

Since hard times tokens were made by citizens for banks to distribute, their value at the time was equal to 1 U.S. cent and surprisingly nobody cared to refuse counterfeits. Are there other cases of citizens revolting and turning to their own currency for use?

1717,Cavalry in Sieges,1,"Cavalry in SiegesHey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So this question is partially inspired because I'm a huge fan of the Total War video games.  That said, one thing that always bothered me about them was how often horses end up involved in siege battles.  As you play through the game, both the attacking and defending forces have the option to use mounted soldier units during the sieges, and in some cases they can really end up crowding the battlefield.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always assumed that horses were never a big part of premodern sieges, especially when it comes to the actual combat, so it always broke my immersion, but I was wondering, am I wrong on this?  Are there examples of widespread use of cavalry  troops in siege battles, even inside city walls?  If so, what eras, how frequently, and how were they used?  Because I still don't feel like I see much practicality in it.  And of course I only mean troops that actually fight on horseback, not traditionally ride horses but dismount for this type of fight.

So I was wondering it is even true or something Ive just read from other sources somehow transplanting itself into Gettysburg. 

During a stop near one of the low stone walls the story was told. Roughly goes as follows 

""Here is where one of the more outlandish stories originates. During the battle a group of Union soldiers was under fire as they took cover behind this stone wall. 2 soldiers in particular of note here, one was a smaller man sitting beside his friend, a behemoth of a man as they were fired upon. As they returned fire the smaller man was hit. He died in the large mans arms, his best friend watching him slip from life. Enraged the large man charged the Confederate force firing upon them taking up a melee weapon(I think it was either a scythe or something else unconventional to be in the hands of a union soldier) throwing chaos among them killing dozens uncaring of any wounds he took. Eventually the Confederates manage to disengage some of their men from the melee and surrond the giant out of his reach. They fire and fell the giant ending his rampage."" 

Im 100% sure thats incorrect in some sense but is a vague semblance to what I remember. If anyone else knows if any stories like that exist from Gettysburg Id be delighted to know.

The problem is, saying ""I'd like to learn about Native Americans"" is a lot like saying ""I'd like to learn about Asia,"" or ""I'd like to learn about physics"" -- it's a huge subject to approach, and as someone with very little background knowledge I just don't know where to begin.

Does anyone know of a book (or books, or other resources) that might serve as a good introduction? I guess I'm looking for a fairly high-level overview just to get oriented to the landscape of Native Americans (before and after the arrival of Europeans on the continent).

Any suggestions you might have will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

If so, what did they find useful, what did they actually use, and what was their source?

I though of this in the dumbest way. After years of US education, I just noticed the similar name between the Articles of *Confederation* and the Iroquois *Confederacy.* I doubt this means anything, but I would assume the Iroquois would be a great source because of their own history, complexity, and proximity. 

Thank you all so much. If this has been asked before/recently, I would appreciate a link so I can see prior answers.

1736,Recommendations for documentaries on major historical events that are less talked about?,1,"Recommendations for documentaries on major historical events that are less talked about?
I realize that the title is a very broad category.  I recently became extremely interested in world history, politics, and the intricacies of different forms of governments.  The more I read and self-discover, the more I realize how horribly ignorant I am and am slightly embarrassed that it‚Äôs taken me until my mid-twenties to try to learn more so that I can make more informed (and less biased) decisions/opinions on government policy, world issues, and the like.  I feel like the American school system has failed in this area, even through the university level.   

Anyway, I‚Äôm beginning to rant.  Some examples of topics I‚Äôd be interested in watching documentaries of are of the Bosnian War, the Greco-Persian wars, The life of Mohammed/the Quran, Constantinople‚Äôs fall, the October Revolution, etc.  Basically anything that is deemed revolutionizing to modern governments, current disputes, things that are big events but not talked about often.    I‚Äôm a little less interested in American history, as that is most of what my education covered.  But I'll still watch or read something that is recommended in this area.   

Books are also awesome recommendations.  Documentaries come to mind first so that I can enjoy watching them with my husband.  

Please help me.  I'm feeling overwhelmed and don't know where to start. Also, itching to learn more.  Thank you in advance!

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it‚Äôs not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)

1746,What are the thoughts of r/history on the emphasis on written history over oral history?,1,"What are the thoughts of r/history on the emphasis on written history over oral history?Obviously there are some undeniable advantages to written history, such as availably, the ability to make copies, accuracy (removing human memory when retelling), etc. However it seems like there's a real prejudice against oral histories, even when it's the only record keeping of a culture.

If we look at Native American culture for example oral storytelling appears to be the main or only way of record keeping in the vast majority of Native American tribes. I realise that many of these stories include metaphors and mysticism, however so does the Bible and it's often looked at in a historical sense to understand the culture and thinking of the Jewish people during the BC years. Despite the mysticism and metaphors in its pages it's often in part considered from a historical perspective. Yet when it comes to Native American culture we seem to consider the writings of white settlers (and the obvious written bias that comes from an outsider to a culture) as more ""reliable"" than the stories of Native Americans.

I'd just like to hear your thoughts on whether r/history thinks this bias is justified or not, and how this bias may lead to a warped emphasis on certain historical events over others (ex. Eurocentrism).",1,what are the thought of r histori on the emphasi on written histori over oral histori,what are the thought of r histori on the emphasi on written histori over oral histori obvious there are some undeni advantag to written histori such as avail the abil to make copi accuraci remov human memori when retel etc howev it seem like there s a real prejudic against oral histori even when it s the onli record keep of a cultur If we look at nativ american cultur for exampl oral storytel appear to be the main or onli way of record keep in the vast major of nativ american tribe I realis that mani of these stori includ metaphor and mystic howev so doe the bibl and it s often look at in a histor sens to understand the cultur and think of the jewish peopl dure the BC year despit the mystic and metaphor in it page it s often in part consid from a histor perspect yet when it come to nativ american cultur we seem to consid the write of white settler and the obviou written bia that come from an outsid to a cultur as more reliabl than the stori of nativ american I d just like to hear your thought on whether r histori think thi bia is justifi or not and how thi bia may lead to a warp emphasi on certain histor event over other ex eurocentr

Here I stumbled upon a so called surrender scheme used by the allies. The planes where painted white and had green crosses applied after capture or surrender to prevent friendly fire when flying them to allied bases. I've seen this on the Mitsubishi A6M and G4M, mostly after the capitulation of Japan

I know surrender was a no go for Japanese troops during the war since they still followed the bushido code. My knowledge about the second world war is mostly European theater and I know that this camo was used after the surrender of Japan. 
So this ringed the following question: ""was this colour used a lot during the war itself or were there barely any captured Japanese aircraft?""

1757,Why did the Hungarian military detoriorate from the Black Army to the Battle of Mohacs?,1,"Why did the Hungarian military detoriorate from the Black Army to the Battle of Mohacs?Hello there!

I've been dabbling into the late medieval - early modern period of Eastern Central Europe and the Balkans lately and so I have, naturally, made acquitances with the Black Army of Hungary that was formed by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus in the second half of the 1400's. 

I've understood that it was one of the first truly ""standing armies"" in Europe and one of the first to adopt firearms as common weapons. It was quite simply put a fearsome foe, but it died soon after their king in 1494 due to financial troubles. 30 years later the Hungarians were decimated by the Ottomans at Mohacs in part due to, as one source (which I of course can't find now) put it, the tactics and lessons of the Black Army being forgotten/not used.

What happened to Hungary in the 30 or so years between Matthiases death and the battle of Mohacs? Why was the institutional knowledge of the Black Army not retained? After all 30 years is a time after which a young officer in his 20's can still lead armies in his 50's. Despite its weapons and organization was there anything else revolutionary about the Black Army and its tactics?

1759,Nero : a bad emperor?,1,"Nero : a bad emperor?Hi everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen some documentaries and read some books that are somewhat perplex about the ""disastrous"" reign of Nero. For example in SPQR, Mary Beard points out that there was some people who claimed to be Nero after his death which could indicate that he was still popular among people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also as you know Nero had problems with the Senate and he was very defiant against the Senate. The ones that wrote about Nero (Suetonius and Tacitus) were not neutral because they were respectively Knight and Senator. There were some conjurations to kill him or to take his power orchestrated by the Senate. Moreover Nero was quite popular among people not senators but the masses.

&amp;#x200B;

Nero is very famous for ""The Great Fire of Rome"" but Nero was not in Rome at this time and some of his favorite collections burnt in the Great Fire which could indicate that he did not start the fire. There are a lot of indications that Nero wasn't that mad or a ""bad emperor"".

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think that Nero was a degenerate emperor as he is so often depicted? And if he is not at what extent was he a good or a bad leader ??

Thunder)?Source: ISBN 978-9949-39-125-7  ""Facts and Legends of Second World War"" by Mati √ïun, Estonian historian  
  
Digging his book again during the morning dump, it just reminded how I simply can't wrap my head around those numbers ( I know I have red a book of his with Much more detailed descriptions, dates and numbers but can't remember the title tho) :  
  
The Red Army and NKVD had on 1st of September 1939 **twice**  as many tanks and tankettes **and twice** as many combat airplanes than the **whole world combined**.  
  
Red Army and NKVD on the 22th of July 1941:  
  
*  32 100 aircraft (of which 24488 were combat aircraft)(altho majority were old and poor condition, like Po-2 biplanes etc)   
*  25 784 tank and tankettes  
*  5 242 armored cars  
*  112 800 pieces of different kind of artillery and mortars  
*  6 114 700 personnel *before* general mobilization  
*  also somewhat ~200 submarines if I recall correctly  
  
On the other hand Wehrmacht and SS had at the time:  
  
*  7 234 000 personnel (after general mobilization)  
*  Luftwaffe had 5070 aircraft (of which 4628 combat aircraft)    
*  5262 tanks and tankettes (of which 3332 were prepared for Barbarossa)  
  
Needless to say Soviet ones are *STRAGGERING* numbers I can't wrap mind onto. Makes perfect sense to me to let Europe weaken themselves while fighting with eachother, then, under the false call of ""liberation of Europe"" from nazism/fascism you invade and proceed to use Europe's massive industry to fuel your world conquering. √ïun also bet the whole Comintern's skirmish in Spain during 1930s was to get foothold onto the other side of Europe to get Groza going from two fronts.  
He also isn't fond of that majority of 'western' historians don't seem to look onto the WWII from operation Groza's point of view as it totally reinvisions the much of the conflict that took place in Europe

1771,Mongolian (and Steppe in general) Horses,1,"Mongolian (and Steppe in general) HorsesSo, I was thinking about buying a modern day Mongolian horse in the US, I found out it is just about impossible unless you are willing to go to Mongolia and ship it to back to the States (I am not BTW).  But, as a byproduct, started reading about modern day Mongolian horses.  I found out they are drastically different (at least through my 15 minutes worth of research) than their modern Western counterparts.  The Western (European particularly) breeds seem to be more geared to towards work.  They are large, and very dependent on commands from their riders.  Where the modern Mongolian horses are much smaller (in many online horse communities refer to them as poney breeds). However, they are very strong for their size, as they are much stockier than the Western breeds.  The difference that I found the most interesting between the breeds, is Western horses must commanded for everything in order to ride them properly; where Mongolian horses are much more independent.  Meaning, the Mongolian breeds more or less do what they want and you don't have to command them in order to avoid obstacles such as large rocks.  Having an independent thinking horse (to me at least) would be highly beneficial for horse archery, as the rider can focus on shooting the opposing army.  However, having a strong very obedient horse would be much better suited to having heavily armored knights, as the rider could command the horse to charge directly into the opposing army and the knight can do his work from there.   

Finally, it seems to me, this has always been the case historically (the difference between the two breeds that is), in particularly in the case of the Mongolian horses.  As it appears the modern day breeds are more or less unchanged since at least the Mongol era, and potentially dating back all the way to the Scythians.  

I just thought this was really cool, and it, to me atleast, explains why the Steppe cultures were so dominate when they attacked Europe when the Europeans were unprepared and disorganized. I thought the community would think this was pretty cool, and I would also like a bit of a BS check too.

1784,Question on the european nobility‚Äôs reaction to the French Revolution vs. the English Civil war,1,"Question on the european nobility‚Äôs reaction to the French Revolution vs. the English Civil warWhen the French Revolution broke out and king Louis XVI was executed and a Republic declared, this created a counter-Revolution movement that united the monarchs and rulers of Europe against France in the largest coalition since, maybe, the crusades. The main reason cited for this is the deep fear that these monarchs had of the revolution‚Äôs new ideas and radicalism.

But when learning about the English Civil war that saw, a century earlier, the beheading of king Charles I and the institution of a Republic, it seems to me that the ideas, reforms and models implemented on the isles were as threatening to the concept of divine kingship as the French Revolution‚Äôs. 

The ¬´¬†Grandees¬†¬ª and Rump Parliament were barely less radical than the Jacobins and Cromwell barely more liberal and conciliatory than Robespierre. And either way, the Counter-Revolution seems to have started before the emergence of these figures in France.

So why didn‚Äôt the removal and beheading of an anointed king and institution of a radical Republic spark the same counter-revolutionary zele in mid-XVIIth century Europe than it did in 1789?

1821,How standard were mercenary armies around 1500 A.D in Italy and around the world?,1,"How standard were mercenary armies around 1500 A.D in Italy and around the world?Hi! Long time lurker, first time poster:

I listened to a conversation with David Wootton regarding a recent book of his: ""Power, Pleasure and Profit"" and it sounded like a great book which thematically ties some of the different heavy-weight philosophers (Machiavelli, Hobbs, Smith, Madison, etc.. ) together on those points.  Well I'm waiting for a used copy of that book to arrive, I remembered I had a copy of ""The Prince"" laying around and it seemed as good a starting place as any!

My question is, within the first few pages of the of the introduction, the author of this translation -- Daniel Donno -- states that a repeated idea by Machiavelli was:

""A healthy state must rely solely upon its own citizen forces in war""

To me it seems normal for a country to provide the soldiers for a conflict/war. A nation at war providing soldiers is the only way -- outside of coalitions which ""add"" soldiers to a conflict -- that soldiers exist at all in today's world... right?. I understand the idea of a hired / mercenary army but don't know of any examples in existence today... Was this idea of not have an army but only hiring one consistent around the world at the time (\~1500)? Or is this only in Italy/places where only smaller nation states existed in place of a larger nation state in order to be able to wage an entire war with only a hired army? Were there / are there any larger nation states who also didn't have their own army and only hired when needed? Are there any parallels to hiring a mercenary army for a war in today's world (secret forces not accountable to citizens seems a bit like a mercenary army to me...)?

1841,Byzantine/Roman Comparison,1,"Byzantine/Roman ComparisonDespite being a largely unbroken continuation of the Ancient Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire military history couldn‚Äôt be any more different than its distant past, at least at first glance. 

The Ancient Roman Empire was one of constant expansion and conquest, a tradition dating back to its days as a republic. 

On the other hand, the Byzantine Empire, despite regaining some of its territory during the Komnenoi and other limited achievements, has (to my recollection) no grand conquests (beyond Justinian‚Äôs) to its name.

What‚Äôs the reason behind this?

Was there an ideological difference between the Romans of old and the Medieval Byzantines that  discouraged conquest in part of the Byzantines (middle and late, since early Byzantines would probably not be too different than late Romans), or was the lack of Byzantine grand conquests more a practical limitation?

Both lasted roughly 1,000 years (I‚Äôm including the Republic for Ancient Rome), so looking back at them, which policy worked best, to expand or not to expand?

1850,Why or how did no catholic power subdue Geneva during the wars between catholics and protestants?,1,"Why or how did no catholic power subdue Geneva during the wars between catholics and protestants?Hello!

I am halfway through ""A Column of Fire"" by Ken Follet (3rd book of the ""Pillars of the Earth"" series), and while I find it vastly inferior to the first two books, it does cover a period I am pretty familiar with, and very fond of since I read the excellent French series ""Fortune de France"" (if you are interested, it has only started being translated very recently, with 3 of the 6 first books available in English, check it out!).

One thing I had never wondered about before that stuck out to me in ""Column"" is how Geneva, the centre of protestant teaching, ruled by Jean Calvin, sending missionaries, translated bibles and other books throughout Europe, survived the military struggles that spanned the period, with catholic powers such as France, Spain and of course the Pope dedicating a lot of energy to suppress heresy.

I am not very clear on the power balance of the area at the time. I think Geneva was an independant city? And not a very big one. Not a major trading power such as the Italian republics‚Ä¶ Switzerland was not united, and I have read that Geneva mainly had an alliance with Bern. I guess together they could still muster a pretty big army, especially since Swiss mercenaries were such a quality force.

But it still feels to me like if France or Spain had wanted to smash the heresy in its heart, they could have gathered an army and marched on Geneva.

Why did they not do this? Is my assessment of Geneva's power wrong? Or (maybe also) did the internal struggles within France/Spain, and the constant power struggle between the 2 kingdoms, prevented them from planning a war abroad, even though Geneva is just on the doorstep of France‚Ä¶ Are there other factors, political or otherwise, that I'm not seeing?",1,whi or how did no cathol power subdu geneva dure the war between cathol and protest,whi or how did no cathol power subdu geneva dure the war between cathol and protest hello I am halfway through A column of fire by ken follet rd book of the pillar of the earth seri and while I find it vastli inferior to the first two book it doe cover a period I am pretti familiar with and veri fond of sinc I read the excel french seri fortun de franc if you are interest it ha onli start be translat veri recent with of the first book avail in english check it out one thing I had never wonder about befor that stuck out to me in column is how geneva the centr of protest teach rule by jean calvin send missionari translat bibl and other book throughout europ surviv the militari struggl that span the period with cathol power such as franc spain and of cours the pope dedic a lot of energi to suppress heresi I am not veri clear on the power balanc of the area at the time I think geneva wa an independ citi and not a veri big one not a major trade power such as the italian republ switzerland wa not unit and I have read that geneva mainli had an allianc with bern I guess togeth they could still muster a pretti big armi especi sinc swiss mercenari were such a qualiti forc but it still feel to me like if franc or spain had want to smash the heresi in it heart they could have gather an armi and march on geneva whi did they not do thi Is my assess of geneva s power wrong Or mayb also did the intern struggl within franc spain and the constant power struggl between the kingdom prevent them from plan a war abroad even though geneva is just on the doorstep of franc are there other factor polit or otherwis that I m not see

1852,"What was a poorly misunderstood or poorly executed idea but was excused that it was for the ""greater good""?",1,"What was a poorly misunderstood or poorly executed idea but was excused that it was for the ""greater good""?For those who do not know, ""the greater good"" has become a meme of itself from the film of Hot Fuzz which is a self-aware comedy about a police man discovering a series of murders happening a remote rural town in England done ""for the greater good"". It sounds absurd to justify murder to execute your intentions and means but then again, that is the entire point becuase plenty of people throughout history have done so many things but justified in whatever manner possible to make themselves feel good or feel like they are doing the right thing. 

The first thing that popped up in my head was the implementation of Communism in Russia, China and the other satellite countries. 

On one hand, the theory and mentality behind it makes sense considering from the time of the Victorian era and the Industrial Revolution, the higher social classes were getting more rich and having more luxury while the lower classes were getting little so I can understand the anger and frustration from the lower classes. 

But in reality, the execution was funnily and hypocritically terrible where the promised ""utopia"" for fairness and equality turned slowly into a state of famine, economic stagnancy and the increase opportunity of corruption, achieving personal power for personal gain and military power. 

It sounds pretty absurd but at the same time, to them it was not and felt that it was for ""the greater good"".

Even other historical events pop up in my head such as the Emu War, World War 1, the fight between Caesar and the Republic (where Caesar, who was probably showing off and wanted to show the Republic just how powerful he was, he used the word ""Clemency"" as part of his slogan), the terrible religious-political tensions during the Medieval times and the Crusades where the papal powers even allowed mini-Crusades against supposed allies or simply people who were not technically Christian but not technically Muslim either (*cough* Fourth Crusade *cough*), the French Revolution which chaotically turned into a nightmare of constant changing of what it desired to be until Napoleon showed up, and so on",1,what wa a poorli misunderstood or poorli execut idea but wa excus that it wa for the greater good,what wa a poorli misunderstood or poorli execut idea but wa excus that it wa for the greater good for those who do not know the greater good ha becom a meme of itself from the film of hot fuzz which is a self awar comedi about a polic man discov a seri of murder happen a remot rural town in england done for the greater good It sound absurd to justifi murder to execut your intent and mean but then again that is the entir point becuas plenti of peopl throughout histori have done so mani thing but justifi in whatev manner possibl to make themselv feel good or feel like they are do the right thing the first thing that pop up in my head wa the implement of commun in russia china and the other satellit countri On one hand the theori and mental behind it make sens consid from the time of the victorian era and the industri revolut the higher social class were get more rich and have more luxuri while the lower class were get littl so I can understand the anger and frustrat from the lower class but in realiti the execut wa funnili and hypocrit terribl where the promis utopia for fair and equal turn slowli into a state of famin econom stagnanc and the increas opportun of corrupt achiev person power for person gain and militari power It sound pretti absurd but at the same time to them it wa not and felt that it wa for the greater good even other histor event pop up in my head such as the emu war world war the fight between caesar and the republ where caesar who wa probabl show off and want to show the republ just how power he wa he use the word clemenc as part of hi slogan the terribl religi polit tension dure the mediev time and the crusad where the papal power even allow mini crusad against suppos alli or simpli peopl who were not technic christian but not technic muslim either cough fourth crusad cough the french revolut which chaotic turn into a nightmar of constant chang of what it desir to be until napoleon show up and so on

1868,Have seconds ever intervened in duels?,1,"Have seconds ever intervened in duels?I tried to ask this in r/AskHistorians but wasn't allowed. But as per the rules of this subreddit I will expand upon my question.

Duels have been a recurrent and surprisingly important type of event in history under many occasions and for many reasons. Of course there are famous examples like the death of Alexander Hamilton, but in a broader societal sense things like judicial duels had far-reaching significance. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Seconds were not always used in duels but when employed they were there in part to intervene in the case of cheating. Obviously the interventions and eyewitness accounts of seconds have surely been important in documenting major duels, but to your knowledge has a second ever actually intervened and stopped a duel while it was taking place?

Arctic foxes, gyrfalcons, reindeer, otters, ravens, humpback whales, gannets, and much more - each creature played a part in their society and culture, with some even ending up as figures in Norse mythology. The Vikings had a deep respect for the land and sea, as it served as their compass and guide.

What political reasoning was behind it?While the actions of the Khmer Rouge are well documented and known, there was always one fundamental question remaining for me:

Why?

Just what event, reasoning or long-term-motivation drove the Khmer Rouge to basically only rely on the most perverse acts of brutality during their reign instead of any other form of governmental power? Looking at their crimes, it basically seems like they were actively trying to be as violent and brutal as possible in their style of governing things. They had no effective administration, bureaucracy or institutions, just senseless violence and the literal slaughtering of their own population

What exactly was their long-term plan for running a state? Did they seriously believe that murdering an increasing percentage of their own population would have no effect on their state? What if the Vietnamese never intervened and the regime remained in Power? Would they literally just have continued to slaughter away their entire population until nobody would have been left? If so, how did they see any value in a situation like this?

I don't know if I'm the only one, but to me none of their actions makes any political sense (aside from them being inhumane to no end) in the long run.

but nowadays suits arent really seen in public that often unless you talk to someone who is working at an office or attending to a formal event such as a fancy party or maybe even a court trial, and even then you dont see people wearing hats anymore
