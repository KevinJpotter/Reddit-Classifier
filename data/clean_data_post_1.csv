8,conspiracy,"So I don't really think many people would challenge the underlying premise of this observation. It is fairly obvious that the music industry tends to promote a lifestyle of extravagance, frivolousness, sexual promiscuity, and a fixation on the ""passion"" or ""fairytale"" parts of a relationship, namely getting together, breaking up, falling in love, or fantasizing about having now met your ""one and only"". None of these things are sustainable and create false ideas of what love for another person really is. I often like to state that I believe the music of Bruno Mars to be much more toxic than even the most vile black metal or brutal gangster rap, simply because he promotes the false image sold to us by western culture which just happens to be the cotton candy oxycontin lifestyle. But for the focus of this post I would like to bring up the song Honey I'm Good by Andy Grammar, I happen to believe that this song is the industry's most obvious statement on this topic. In the song Andy speaks of being at a bar and being asked to join another patron for a drink, Andy wants to but knows that if he does he will likely cheat, so he instead decides to stop having fun in order to stay true. When you consider the fact that the entire song is set to a goofy Cotton Eyed Joe-like tune the message is fairly obvious,  this is meant to be a mockery of the faithful mentality. It's nauseating redundancy solidifies this opinion and the songs promotion of the square/uncool person who engages in this kind of behavior. Just curious what you guys think, when I first heard this song on the radio it struck me as very obviously angled to a particular cause and I'm interested if you guys think there are other songs out there which follow a similar pattern. ","The music industry actively mocks the idea of fidelity in a relationship, celebrates sexual deviancy and non-committed relationships.The collapse of the family."
9,conspiracy,"Heres everything I know and that has happened so far (there may be something I missed so feel free to add):

&amp;#x200B;

I subscribed to a Youtube channel about a young guy who seemed to just make things in his workshop. His most recent videos were becoming odd though.. He explained more and more that the reason he took a year off from uploading was so he could form relations with ""powerful people."" He then claimed the winning Powerball numbers for the following day were placed in the video because the lotteries are rigged by the rich for them to win.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next upload he said the same thing: the winning lottery numbers were hidden in the video. The title was disgiused because he noted it would ""stay up longer"".

&amp;#x200B;

Everything about them raised red flags for me as being a hoax, but I posted it on this Reddit anyway. In hindsight that was a fuckin stupid idea because if he had happened to upload another one I might've been able to win. Luckily, he didn't.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b519es/guy\_showed\_the\_winning\_numbers\_for\_wednesdays/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b519es/guy_showed_the_winning_numbers_for_wednesdays/)

&amp;#x200B;

And, as it turns out he wasn't bullshitting. Twice in a row, he displayed winning lottery numbers a full day before the drawing. The first video had sticky notes with the numbers attached to his hat and the second just literally showed them as text mid-video.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so fucking frustrated and angry that I subscribed literally less than a day too late to be able to play the numbers! The few people who had seen the video prior to me either didn't see the numbers or didn't believe him because there were no jackpot winners on the 20th and 23rd. I just try to keep telling myself that it was meant to be, especially because of what happened next.

&amp;#x200B;

His final video was of him almost in tears saying that ""they"" were almost to him. He noted he was previously slowly giving out the number combos as so to not raise suspicion due to many winners. But because he knew he was going to get captured anyway he gave a link to a deep web (or dark web or whatever, i'm not savvy with this stuff) website that the rich apparently use to coordinate what numbers to play and what times to win.

[the only evidence I have that this video ever existed](https://i.redd.it/q8sk9cgu6rp21.png)

I didn't manage to record this video because I was still at work but I did write down the website. I had my tech buddy look it up immeditely, and he said the site was already down, less than an hour after the guy showed it running in the video. Also at this time all of his videos were deleted. Totally not weird at all.

Site: 9sdgnehfarver911.onion

&amp;#x200B;

A bit later I got an email from Reddit about a DMCA takedown request for my post. It talked about legal action and stuff, so I immediately deleted the post (I found out later that was unnecessary. Sorry I got kinda scared, I'm still new to Reddit. I created my account a couple years back but I haven't really liked this site until I tried it again last month).

https://i.redd.it/8z3woxcu6rp21.png

Today was the nail in the coffin. He uploaded a suspicous AF video saying that it was all an April Fool's joke. I don't buy it. It's really forced and obviously scripted, and still doesn't explain how the hell he actually did show the winning numbers a full day before any of the drawings.

44,conspiracy,"The Climate Change Business Journal has calculated that global warming is now a $1.5 trillion a year industry. The Business Journal’s report is not available for free online, but its findings are reviewed by the Insurance Journal. They are eye-opening, to say the least:

The $1.5 trillion global “climate change industry” grew at between 17 and 24 percent annually from 2005-2008, slowing to between 4 and 6 percent following the recession with the exception of 2011’s inexplicable 15 percent growth, according to Climate Change Business Journal.

The San Diego, Calif.-based publication includes within that industry nine segments and 38 sub-segments. This encompasses sectors like renewables, green building and hybrid vehicles.

One of the most lucrative segments of the global warming money tree is consulting:

That also includes the climate change consulting market, which a recent report by the journal estimates at $1.9 billion worldwide and $890 million in the U.S.

Included in this sub-segment, which the report shows is one of the fastest growing areas of the climate change industry, are environmental consultants and engineers, risk managers, assurance, as well as legal and other professional services.

What is striking about the global warming industry is that its growth is driven more or less entirely by “policymaking,” i.e., government mandates and other policies. This is why “green” businesses contribute so lavishly to the political campaigns of politicians who drink the global warming Kool-aid.

When I first noticed it, I began reporting the posts but it doesn't seem like anything has changed in well over a couple months which leads me to believe one of the following scenarios:

1) Reddit admins know about it and can't stop it (It's a honey pot/active investigation, etc.)

2) Reddit admins know about it and are complicit in the activity.

3) Reddit admins don't know and the reporting is handled via some auto-pilot scheme.

SS: Im going to be as Quick and as to the point as I can be.  I was out in the backyard enjoying the day when what looked like a blue and red low flying commercial airliner traveling 300 degrees NW slightly before 1pm AZ time caught the corner of my eye. It appeared to have a black object come from it. The object began moving upward. 

I watched the object for awhile because honestly I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a bird. When I made up my mind that it wasn’t a bird I ran into the house to get a camera better than my iPhones capabilities. When I returned outside I immediately looked for the black object. No luck. 

When I then went to look for the commercial airliner I got distracted by a loud noise. I looked above and a fighter jet flew overhead traveling from the South Heading North. Now the conspiracy wheels are spinning......

2 more fighter jets show up. Then a 4th. They make a big circle around the area and head North/West.

If anyone else has any more info it would be greatly appreciated. Oh, and I did snap some photos of the fighter jets. This is not an April fools Joke. I’m probably the fool. I’m sure there is a logical explanation. Some kind of Air-force exercise or something. Thanks!

Today I was watching this video (https://youtu.be/HVIF_Mvx7Vw) and starting at 4:48 you start to hear about the underground city in Moscow, Russia and it’s insight on this travel system (trains) and hubs of entertainment.

So here I am asking about metro’s weird and ironic placement in time. I do feel a war is very close and I’m planning to prepare food,water,ammo and all that’s needed to survive. I also have thoughts of alien/demons invasions due to these random triangles in the sky or CERN pop’in creatures from a portal during the aftermath and really creating a sense of metro 2033. 

All I know is there are a collection of strange events both physically, spiritually. I’m the type of mind who believes that movies,tv,music tell details of future events and preps the subconscious for a setting or event that is soon to come. Could metro be one of those games?

Hey everyone! Well, I'm probably crazy, but I'm going to the Richat Structure in Mauritania to investigate many coordinates that seem to show man-made structures. Also doing some tests and hoping to uncover something there! Heavily inspired since I saw Bright Insight's incredible videos on Atlantis!  


**My video report on my journey can be found here:**  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Lc8KxbhigE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lc8KxbhigE)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's my original article for the video:**  
In this video, I report on my plan to go to the Richat Structure in Mauritania to search for Atlantis, the so-called mythical ancient city detailed by Plato in his Critias and Timaeus dialogues thousands of years ago.

We have decided that the best way to find out the truth is to go to the site itself and explore on the ground using coordinates that appear to be the most promising.

The number of pieces of evidence are so overwhelming that it's hard to write down in a simple description.

The Richat Structure, also known as ""The Eye Of The Sahara"" and ""The Eye Of Africa"" lays deeps in the Sahara Desert in the country of Mauritania. It is on a plateau covered in water erosion and is the perfect size to be the city Plato recounted from the info handed down by his ancestor Solon. It is 23.5kms around the main island. Exactly as recounted. It opens to the south with mountains covered in rivers to the north. It has fresh water in the center island and salt water throughout the other rings. That area of the Sahara used to be jungle before suddenly turning to desert in a catacylsm. You can see from space that much of the land was washed out as if land slid from the mantle into the ocean.

As we've detailed greatly here at WAM, nearly every ancient civilization spoke of a great catacylsm, most of a flood that washed out coastal cities and set humanity back. Interestingly, of the 600 civilizations that recounted such an event throughout the world with no known connection with each other, the majority of the stories are the SAME with slight variations. Science has now proven that there was a massive climate cataclysm around the end of the Younger Dryas Period.

Put this together with the fact that in recent years, the true origin of civilizations throughout the world have changed people's perspective massively. Many academic researchers claimed for centuries that civilizations begun around 3000BC. As if people stopped climbing trees to suddenly build the greatest structures in human history that we still cannot replicate to this day and then slowly forget how to build such structures as structures got more and more primitive over time.

Then we've found Gobekli Tepe in the past 20+ years that dates back to the 10th century BC which then randomly got buried in the 8th on purpose. So civilizations suddenly advanced, built amazing building and then stopped for 5,000 years, then begun again. The storyline put forward by the major academics of the space has gotten ridiculous.

From water erosion on The Sphinx in Egypt (which claimed to be an outpost of Atlantis) to perfectly fitting polygonal blocks at Machu Picchu, we have been lied to and the Richat Structure near the Atlas Mountains and the Sea of Atlas (Atlantic Ocean) appears to be most likely site of Atlantis (The Island Of Atlas). So we're going there!

We will bring you on site video soon! Stay tuned and wish us luck!",I'm Going To The Richat Structure To Investigate Atlantis!

It's being more than two years of Trump presidency, but issue with Russian meddling is still looming. It seems that two years is more, than enough to find something, doesn't it? If there is something to find. And if you're searching in a right place. But for now, despite of titanic efforts, there is not even a hint was spotted… It seems everything's pretty obvious - there is the result, there is the customer, there are professional intelligence analysts, but there is no result at all. What's going on? What's wrong?

Common sense rings that something is wrong - something from the set of things or the context. There is no doubt that the team of investigators is professional. Maybe somewhat influenced, but that would be clear after so long period of time. The result is obvious too - Trump defeated the almost 100% favorite Clinton. What about who ordered the hit?

Well, the customer-result pair at first glance only seems obvious. If Putin is a customer, it means that the result must have been political. But there is a problem - the longer than clearer. Only according to pro-Clinton mass media Trump is Putin's puppet. In reality a lot of his decisions made Putin angry. Moreover, sometime it seems there is no sense in his decisions at all. However, Trump made millions (and not once after hitting the bottom), so it's not likely there is no sense. Possibly, we just don't see it. Like for the same reason we don't drive a Rolls Royce and instead use subway. Just don't see opportunities to make enough to afford a Rolls Royce. It doesn't mean we are silly, we just see other things in life that, possible, can not help to make money, but they are important other ways. Money is not the happiness itself. By the way, constant Trump's stress is a good example of that common idea.

Well, what can be wrong in the pair customer-result? Obviously, the leading part there is the result. But the result not necerssary has to be  the one and only - presidency of the most powerful country in the world offers countless options. What was the result that all those mysterous hidden players played for? Seems the outcome has so many options that whatever you choose, it fits the goal. But let's not give up.

Where can find so essential hint? As usual - history will help!

Trump - one of a rare case of presidents, who actually follows his election promises. Since the election outcome was surprising, it's logically to test his promises for surprising ones. Was something unusual, somethining, that usually nobody promised? Seems nothing… Just regular stuff about new jobs, more effective economy, politics… Wait a minute! There was a thing! Returning to the Moon! Long years of complete silence and - snap! - here it is! A candidate with pretty questionable chances bring that subject from a dusty attic.

No, really, everybody are into Mars, Sun, asteroids, comets, deep space exploration…

 But the Moon… Dead, eroded by meteorites, without any atmosphere Earth's satellite? It's hard to count how many robotic devices were there, gathered a lot of interesting info. And landing of astronauts that added a huge chunk of understanding of the Moon. It was perfect training of extraterrestrial landing, since the Moon is a planet type satellite that gave perfect opportunity to play in a satellite “sandbox”. But all results dubbed a simple fact that there is hardly something left to research at the Moon and almost everything significant was already well researched. Why  drowning in that old pool again?

However, there are a lot of people full of doubts that somebody actually visited the Moon. They claimed everything was shot in Hollywood. And there is time to come to the Moon for real. Are they right?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/f08lj6ej1rp21.jpg

 Not likely. One thing is to fake one Moon landing. The whole different story is to fake several times, especially under the close surveillance of the counterparts, especially USSR, that had pretty serious plans to win that race.

On the other hand, there are a lot of strange things in the US Moon program. For example, it turns out, Saturn 5, the mightiest rocket ever since is impossible to rebuild even at the current technology level.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l9cdmbbn1rp21.png

 The Moon soil was lost somewhat. And other small things, where, as everybody knows, the devil hides...

Well, landed or not landed? No, it is the wrong question. It's not the question if there was the expedition, since it's obvious that Moon landing was real. The real question is - why landing?

And here the most interesting part begins.

Indeed, results of robotic probes' work were pretty detailed and gave adequate picture what the Moon is. Why risk human lives? For sake of winning the space or, more accurate, Moon race? C'mon, it's childish. Why go there “in person”? What else could we expect that robotic probes missed? And do this several times?

Wait a minute! What if from the beginning there was nothing planned to bring from the Moon? In contrary! It was the plan to deliver something to the Moon!

Hmm… Well, under that angle… No, really, if there was nothing to bring back from the Moon, that explains why everybody were so careless about the Moon soil - and, naturally, lost it. Same thing with the unique rocket Saturn-5 - “show is over, everybody is free!”;.

Great. One mystery is solved - got a new one. What exactly was that thing that should be delivered to the Moon? What shouldn't be left at Earth?

Maybe, that is not a question at all? Maybe, they send something, that doesn't belong to Earth?

Let's make a break. What was before space flights? Calculations, designing, inventions… But in the beginning was a dream. What, excluding will, was the ground idea of space flights? Of course, meteorites, that fell from the sky . But one thing - dead lifeless stones. Humans always were in search of somebody else to contact. What outstanding happened just before start of space exploration? UFO? Again those fairy tales about aliens?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/nrgczwss1rp21.jpg

 However, there is no smoke without a fire. Were strange cases in the USA just before technological breakthrough in that area? Oh, yeah. Did something strange crashed down that in a snap was declared top secret? And just after that - breakthrough! So really were there small green men there who gave us wanted technologies? Well, where are those technologies?

What a question? We already mentioned Saturn-5 and despite efforts nobody recreated it since! It seems, aliens were here and shared their technologies with us, but just to flee from Earth. And did it so smart that we are unable to reuse them anymore. Completely reasonable regarding savages who we are, if we compare our technologies with aliens' intergalactic flights.

Now whole story looks completely different! USA not just contacted aliens, they also hid that from humankind! That also changed the nature of Moon race against Soviet Union! USSR didn't want to win, they wanted to prevent it at all. They tried to stop the USA from secret smuggling alien technologies or even aliens themselves under the cover of regular Moon trip. The failure of USSR's Moon project logically led to switching to a new program - Lunokhod that actually was designed not for the Moon exploration, but for searching of where and what Americans brought to the Moon and hid! Also that explains why Americans needed several trips and after that abrupt end of all Moon projects, including Lunokhod one. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1d9mq00y1rp21.jpg

 Russian sent Lunokhod-1 to find what americans hid. But they didn't find anything at the first site and sent another one - Lunokhod-2, preparing next one - Lunokhod-3 (that you can see now in Russian museum). When  they calculated expenses and predicted how much they need for next steps, they realized, that statistics plays against them and wrapped up the project. Really, if you hid something carefully, it’s a problem to find it. Multiply that to the rest of trips and considering nobody knows which trip was the real one...

Do you think, Russians gave up to return artefacts or aliens? No way! Russians always were devoted or even stubborn in reaching their goals

But Soviet Union collapsed and Roscosmos now not in a good shape. However, nothing is simple with Russians. Superpower USSR fell almost instantly. Who is naive enough to believe in that sort of fairy tales? Even with help of powerful Western Intelligence. Soviet KGB was able to give a huge head start to any similar Western “firm”. Way more realistic is planned demolition. But why?

 Let’s take a look behind, to the past. History teaches that strategy wins. You can lose a battle, but win the war. And Russian history has a lot of such examples. Kutuzov left Moscow for Napoleon's loitering

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b515e2x52rp21.jpg

 and won the war, as a winner entered Paris.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/q196bku82rp21.jpg

 For sake of the first in history socialist state Russians without any hesitation sacrificed Russian Empire. When contact with alien civilization was at stake what do you think Russian decided, considering their natural altruism? They decided to go all-in! If there is no way to find something American hid at the Moon, it's better to make Americans bring that back themselves. For sake of humanity. And that is the bet that is worth to sacrifice something significant for.

Exactly for that USSR was turned down, for the same reason they make everybody believe in their weakness and in the same time put into every important agency or company their agents (remember, exile of Soviet Jews, who, according to the unbending statistics were at the frontier everywhere, including intelligence). And eventually they reached the turning point. By the way, it is enough to mention Sergey Brin, descendant of Soviet Jews, now co owner of Google that spies on everyone in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/eonr6u3f2rp21.png

 With that sort of information it's not a rocket science for KGB and its descendant FSB to be so successful.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uqa9fq1k2rp21.jpg

 Yes, it's time to launch the plan to retrieve whatever was hid at the Moon. And Trump promised to open again the Moon program in his election speeches.

So it's pointless to search links between Trump and Putin. Putin himself a puppet of real puppet masters, skillfully control all the show. And American intelligence, indeed, overlooked real goals of Russians. Actually, it's a common among enemies of Russia. Another win… As usual, Russia is at the edge of the progress leading whole mankind with her.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/be7hzosq2rp21.jpg

 By the way, take a look at the China\&amp;rsquo;s Moon program, that is so friendly to Russia recently. And notable passive Roscosmos, especially regarding new technologies development. Without any rush they are selling overstock of Soviet made rocket engines like RD-180. It\&amp;rsquo;s pointless to invest into those obsolete technologies, expecting aliens\&amp;rsquo; ones that will be returned by Russian proxy in the White House from the Moon, where cunning predecessors tried to hide from the rest of humanity. And Russia, just like USSR will be the first among all humanity in the endless way to the future. As turns out, Russia has never left that leading position.

135,conspiracy,"#Monopolistic protectionist policies in medical (medical field generally) school admissions reduces the supply of medical providers, further raises the barrier to entry, and reduces competition among providers.  This reduces medical patient options in the care/treatment process, reinforces the power of licensing monopolies, reinforces a small elite of medical providers, decreases competition among medical professionals, decreases the motivation for quality among medical professionals, creates an artificial scarcity of medical professionals, and encourages higher healthcare costs.


------------------------

Note:  discussion on 'more doctors doesn't matter if there's not more beds' is sometimes brought up as an excuse for monopolistic practices effecting the size of the medical workforce and easy access to medical care.  First, there are other factors affecting the artificial scarcity in medicine such as crony 'certificates of need' which serve to limit distribution of medical facilities and equipment. Second, medical providers benefit from making healthcare artificially scarce by getting higher prices and more elitist status.


&gt;The study, being published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found that the incomes of primary care doctors and orthopedic surgeons were substantially higher in the United States than in other countries. Moreover, it said, the difference results mainly from higher fees, not from higher costs of the doctors’ medical practice, a larger number or volume of services or higher medical school tuition.

&gt;The average U.S. general-medicine physician makes $218,173 a year — nearly double the average of all 11 countries. American specialists make $316,000, while their counterparts take home $98,452 in Sweden and $202,291 in Australia. American nurses make considerably more than elsewhere, too.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;What's Not Driving Up Prices: Too Much Care
&gt;
&gt;Foremost among the conclusions of the new Harvard paper is that unnecessary care — tests and procedures that do nothing to promote health — is not the biggest driver of America’s high health spending.

#Monopolistic practices in medical school and licensing authority and the manipulation of the supply (and price) of medical care


&gt;One of the most critical supply side issues in health care is the supply of qualified doctors.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The case of health care regulations is an interesting one, as state governments have empowered private medical boards with unilateral authority to set the rules for the medical profession, including the issuing and revoking of medical licenses. These boards effectively function like government regulatory agencies, with the important difference that they lack the opportunity for public comments, and thus are immune from any political pressure from citizens.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Retail clinics, pharmacies, and even supermarkets are capable of offering routine medical services to patients with a convenience and regularity impossible in traditional physicians’ offices. Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) has aggressively lobbied against the availability of this type of facility.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;There are currently only 129 accredited medical schools in the United States, too few to turn out enough doctors to meet the demand.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;By reducing the regulatory burden on physicians, providing more competition among medical boards, and permitting more autonomy for alternative practitioners, patients could see both relief from the coming doctor shortage, as well as lower prices across the board for medical care.

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-19/how-government-helped-create-coming-doctor-shortage

&gt;To some extent, dentistry created its own problem. Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Health Association, said today's shortage of dentists can be traced to the closing of seven dental schools in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1980, he said, the United States produced 6,300 dentists. Ten years later, the number was down to 4,000.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Some groups representing doctors are resisting similar efforts to allow nurse practitioners to, for example, write prescriptions and admit patients to the hospital.

https://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2013/12/30/are_there_enough_doctors_for_the_newly_insured_786.html

&gt;The Association of American Medical Colleges has recently predicted a nationwide shortage of somewhere between 40,800 and 104,900 physicians by 2030.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ironically, one of the biggest obstacles to improving access to health care providers is the profession itself, enabled by a plethora of public and private agencies that control licensing and certification. These often inadvertently limit access to care rather than enhance it.

Remember when Illuminati were accused of ""programming"" young people through their music videos around 2009?

Take a look at youth subculture now. I was born in 1999. From Internets point of view I can admit that we can be loosely divided into two groups. 

First is people actively participating in the internet culture, creating memes, lurking for hours on various forums and being in touch with most of new trends.
 
The second contains people who ""consume"" effects of first one, but they dont pay that much attention to ""running"" Internet culture. 

Both of them are incredibly passive compared to other generations. We are somewhat afraid of making inappropiate things. Partly because we were raised in envinroment that catches us into invisible web. When you are going to do something wrong, you instantly think that there is something that fastens the world together; if you make a protest and got yourself into jail, thanks to computers systems police stations in whole country will now be able to search about your """"crime"""" for further cases. If you spray something its very likely that CCTV will catch you and you'll be found soon. Etc. etc. The times when you could do protest in the city centre and ran away into your house without consequences no longer exists.

But... how about the rest of will to do *something*? This is incredibly gone. Nobody of my friends would even care about doing something more than legal protest. If any sort of uprise or anger occures, it ends in fucking memes or legal actions in world of social media/allowed protests. Most of my friends dont care about politics at all. 

Everybody uses the same social media, which culture is somewhat bland compared to older. We are still joking about having no hope, lots of us have depression. Being bad at life is more socially acceptable than being good; you stumble upon stupid ""i want to kill myself"" jokes everyday. If somebody dont have depression (like me. I have it too, dont accuse me of minimizing problem, because I know it exists, and how depression affects people etc.), he still jokes about it. We, 20-year olds, act like 40-50 year ones in some fields. We are filled with giant nostalgia to lots of things, including that songs from 2009.

Yeah, 2009. 2009-2012 was peak of so-called ""Illuminati"" songs. Rihanna, william, Eminem and other ones were believed to be part of this society. 

But look, how its hard to stumble upon any ""illuminati"" song in 2019. Black Eyed Peas are releasing random shit, some dead stars still record. But they dont count in big music industry anymore. 

Why? Because the operation has ended.

Generation which have basically no will to do anything and just act passively in life was raised. ","When Illuminati theories popped out around 2009 and became incredibly popular, they got laughed off and forgotten with time. Now, seeing behaviour of 90s generation I think that they could be true."

My wife and me have to sell a lot of our stuff right now.

How do you do it? Why, Craigslist of course!

Aside from a garage sale, which doesn't work well if you live in a more remote neighborhood. And even then, what do you do? Announce it on CL, yes.

And Craigslist is, mildly put, not very good. I'm not even talking about the 90s design. It's missing a lot of features, stuff doesn't always work well even as it should, and the site doesn't innovate at all. They don't integrate well with other software either. You have to manually re-post your stuff. It gets abused by shady businesses in a lot of ways.

And they have no competition at all in most places.

Here's an article by propaganda/advertising outlet Wired, that tells us ""ok so CL is not very good, but that's just fine and awesome actually!"" (the ""war is peace"" model I guess): https://www.wired.com/2009/08/ff-craigslist/

But what's interesting in this piece is that the founder, Craig Newman, is very enigmatic and loves to dodge questions. About his money, the share he still holds in the company, his responsibilities and decision-making power and other things.

Why is that?

Here's my theory.

If you subscribe to one of the various popular theories that say there are factions on and/or off this planet that are dependent on making people's lives miserable, does it not make perfect sense to have something like Craigslist in place? Serving the very basic need of buying and selling stuff new and used, and services of all kinds, with a local spin, but doing it in a way that creates a lot of stress and frustration and worry, and preventing others from entering the field? A project like this also comes with the awesome advantage of being a massive data collection facility.

So what if this guy Craig Newman devised the site in the 90s in Frisco, striving to make our lives better using the internet, and as it got more popular someone from the Alphabet Soup stepped in and offered him a deal he couldn't refuse, resulting in him becoming their puppet? He also seems to have a weird relationship with his CEO:

&gt; The current CEO, Jim Buckmaster, joined the site in 2000 as a programmer and handles every business and strategic issue.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; Ask Newmark about any feature you would like to see on craigslist and you will always get the same response.
&gt;
&gt; ""Ask Jim,"" he says.
&gt;
&gt; ""How do you get your feedback? Have you ever done a poll or anything like that?""
&gt;
&gt; ""The thought makes me tired. But you can suggest that to Jim if you wish.""
&gt;
&gt; ""What if Jim says no?""
&gt;
&gt; ""If you want to ask him again, you can,"" he says.
&gt;
&gt; At this point in our conversation I begin to feel the spirit of Charlie Rose upon me. After all, Newmark is the founder, a major shareholder, and the public face of the company.
&gt;
&gt; ""What would it take to get you to fire Jim?"" I ask.
&gt;
&gt; Newmark matches me mischief for mischief.
&gt;
&gt; ""Ask Jim.""

Jim is his handler? You decide.

If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”  Compare King David who said, [""Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God""](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+20&amp;version=NIV) or to Goliath, [“You come to me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies...""](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+17&amp;version=NLT). There is power to be had gifted from [the One enthroned in heaven](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/123.htm).  

Even Jesus's disciples experienced the amazement bestowed by Him:

The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.”  He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.  I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.  However, [do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2010&amp;version=NIV), but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”

Yet it was not without it's own confusion.  Take for example the boy possessed by an impure spirit:

When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. “What are you arguing with them about?” he asked. A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.” “You unbelieving generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.” So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has he been like this?” “From childhood,” he answered. “It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” “‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.” Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” he said, “I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.” The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.” But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” He replied, [“This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.""](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%209&amp;version=NIV)

There are many other stories demonstrating the power of God and his holy host; such as [Angel Raphael driving out the demon](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit+8&amp;version=RSVCE) Asmodeus, [Jesus of Nazareth healing the man possessed by a legion of demons](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+5&amp;version=ESV), or [Saint Paul and the slave-girl who had a spirit of divination driven from her through Jesus's name](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+16&amp;version=AMP), but for the sake of brevity I will stop here.  

So what, what's the point?  Many but at the moment it's presented itself as two fold.  One being we must remember who the enemies are and the ongoing cosmic battle.  While it's easy to let hate harden your heart and desire the cup of violence when considering any of our recent atrocities such as [Waco](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=g74LpP80w4w), [OKC](https://washingtonsblog.com/2015/04/okc.html), [9/11](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk), [Pedogate](http://archive.is/9Rwof), etc. it's imperative to put love into action.  As Saint Paul stated:

Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.  Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.  Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.  Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.  Share with the Lord’s people who are in need.  Practice hospitality.  Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.  Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.  Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.  Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.  If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.  Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.  On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.  In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”  [Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12+&amp;version=NIV)

At the same time Scripture reminds us of our duty toward the less fortunate:

Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. [Rescue the weak](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+82&amp;version=NIV) and the needy, deliver them from the hand of the wicked.  [Speak out on behalf of the voiceless, and for the rights of all who are vulnerable.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31&amp;version=CEB)  Speak out in order to judge with righteousness and to defend the needy and the poor.

Remember, we love because he first loved us.  [Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4&amp;version=NIV). For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.  And he has given us this command: anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.

Again so what, what's the point?  Here's the second fold.  If you want to be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power you must put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.  In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.  Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  The Bible doesn't just say to read the Bible but to meditate on it daily.  Like any soldier preparing for battle, one must endure the trials and tribulations in preparation for the time of testing.  [No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012)  Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

176,conspiracy,"there is a huge group of scammers that originated on forums like www.bluelight.org in the late 90's or early 2000's and is still going today. they started with the silk road when ross ulbricht came up with the idea. one of these people told on ross and after this the dark net went into an disarray. back then it was about trust and everything worked. 

this new group came together and made /d/darknetmarkets to get the markets name out there and deepdotweb.com so people can find the links. i have known about all the blue light stuff but i thought the dark web was too complicated and never looked into it for years. then when bitcoin started to gain more traction i took the plundge and it was quite easy to get into.

i used to follow the /r/darknetmarkets sub and laugh my ass off thinking it was real. i had no idea that it was a group of people playing good cop bad cop and making rival vendors who was really the same guy (think burger king mcdonalds rivalry but same guy behind both businesses acting like competition) and the subreddit was almost fully censored. 

if you went there and spoke bad about some vendor then your post would get removed. it was all really strange. for around a year or so i got really interested and got deeper into posting because i was thinking there is some strange shit going on here. i realized by the end that they were running a giant scam and listing markets on deep dot web to exit scam a huge market and then people just flood the next and it is the same business anyway. they really need have real people that sell drugs but these market owners make accounts and drop ship real vendors products and if they lose the contact they either exit scam or straight scam and they own the market so nobody knows. if people come back they just remove the post. /r/darknetmarkets was finally banned. 


i realised that i needed to make a forum. i made gangstas paradise forum. it is honestly a peice of shit and i am burning it soon but here is the link if anyone wants to check it out.

gangstas5qsooiz7.onion.ws

(anyone can see this but i would use TOR)


so just as i was about to launch this website a new website came out called dread and it is a reddit clone for the darknet. it was really nice and i instantly new they came back. when me or any people were talking about my site on reddit they were getting removed and users were getting banned in the new subs on reddit. /r/darknet even had a rule about my forum that you can not talk about it there. the other darknet sub is pretty much completely censored with the hardest filters. i was posting there fine for a while and a new mod came in and all of a sudden all talk about the forum was banned. 

i was asking deepdotweb.com if my forum could be listed. i had no idea they were in on the scam at the time. and they just kept saying wait some time. finally after 4 months they said sure we can put you on now. they put us on and then instantly took us off claiming an uproar in the darknet. he told me that hugbunter the owner of dread didn't want it. i said a few harsh words about the guy for making me look bad on my forum about him and hugbunter and he made a lie on deep dot web that we promote cp on the forum and people should avoid it.

(just a note i fuck hot chicks)

after this i start to realise that in actuality the owner of deepdotweb is a pedo fag. he actually brought the website out as a cp news website that got famous after the playpen scandel. he follows me around everywhere on his daily users bitching about my forum. you can look at my post history to see it. i found his other user and he is always browsing /r/teenagers and even offering money to sexual acts with them. 

Proof- https://linx.li/pedofag.png

now here is the catch with deepdotweb and dread. i told you about the good cop bad cop. well they are a group of scammers so they are not trustworthy. dread has another site call darkwebnews and it is a competing site to deepdotweb. he knows this and gets angry. yesterday they were trying to promote it alot. i went and looked at his sub reddit which i have not looked in a while because i am banned and it sucks now this mod is in charge. the top post is talkign shit about dread.

so i go there just now and this is what i see.

&gt;Be very careful with Dreddit the forum that claims to be a place to speak openly about the darkweb. 

&gt;https://i.imgur.com/1pHm7sp.png 


this is the top post on a sub that has 120,470 subscribers. It is a guy who went to a darknet forum and wanted to post about cp but they removed it and it has almost 50 upvotes. i read the rules of this forum so i am not posting the subreddit but reddit needs to do something about this shit because it is fucking sick first off and second off scaming users non stop.

In the Colonial era, England had sponsored Creek and other Indians against the colonies. England tried to restrict the colonists east of the Appalachians so that the colonies don't become too powerful. After the Revolution, England continued to loom in the shadows by encouraging Indians to raid American territory and this became one of the causes of the war of 1812. 

During the American civil war, England supplied the Confederacy with Enfield guns and smuggling ships which may have lengthened the war for up to two years.

&gt;... substantial sections of Britain’s business elite were working with impunity to help the slave-owning southern states win the Civil War – despite the fact that Britain was officially neutral  and had outlawed slavery almost 30 years earlier.

&gt;The entirely illegal, but tacitly British-Government-approved pro-Confederate gun-running operation is thought to have lengthened the American Civil War by up to two years – and to have therefore cost as many as *400,000 American lives*.

Most Americans didn't like what England stood for. But around the time of the first World War public opinion flipped. Since then, mostly thanks to English propaganda, America has loved England.

Today, according to the late Lyndon LaRouche, the British are responsible for funding Democrats against Donald Trump causing a huge rift in US politics keeping Americans divided and weak. 

Please let me know your thoughts. I used to think a certain country in the Middle East was America's main enemy these days, but according to LaRouche it's England.

Obama came to the White House to shouts of ""yes we can."" But on numerous issues, he leaves office on a ""no he couldn't"" note. That's nowhere more true than it is with his bold promises to fundamentally transform the nation's energy and transportation industries.

He promised a vast network of high-speed rail, a ""smart"" electric grid, a million electric cars on the roads, a ""clean energy economy"" creating millions of new green jobs. And he spent lavishly to realize this dream. But as he leaves office, Obama has little to show taxpayers for all of their money he's poured into these efforts.

Roads: 

Obama's stimulus included more than $105 billion for what he called the ""largest new investment in America's infrastructure since President Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System."" Not only would this massive spending on ""shovel ready"" projects create jobs, he said it would reduce congestion and save 14,000 lives a year.

But all that money made almost no difference in the quality of the nation's roads, bridges airports and other infrastructure. The grade given by American Society of Civil Engineers for the state of the nation's overall infrastructure when from a ""D"" to a ""D+."" In other words, it went from poor to only slightly less poor. And the Transportation Department reports that highway congestion is worse now than it was in 2009.

Electric cars: 

Obama said he'd put a million electric cars on the road by investing massively in battery technology while heavily subsidizing the cars themselves with a generous tax credit. In 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the price tag for Obama's dream would be nearly $8 billion over 10 years. But electric car sales have consistently underwhelmed, leaving the nation nowhere near that 1 million mark. Electric cars remain a tiny niche market heavily subsidized by millions of taxpayers who have no interest in owning one.

High-speed rail: 

Early in his administration, Obama fantasized about creating a network of high-speed rail lines across the country. He poured $8 billion worth of stimulus money into the project, hoping to get rail lines started in 10 regions. Only one has seriously pursued Obama's dream — California — which got $3.5 billion in federal grants. But its effort is foundering amid skyrocketing costs and endless construction delays.

Renewable energy: 

Obama spent billions of taxpayer dollars subsidizing windmills and solar plants as part of his vision of a ""clean energy"" future. But despite his repeated claims about a huge increase in renewable energy production, renewables today make up just 11% of the nation's total energy production, according to the Energy Information Administration. In mid-1983, the share of energy production comprised of renewables was … 11%. The biggest shift in energy under Obama came not from a government program, but from fracking, which vastly expanded the supply of domestic oil and natural gas.

Smart grid: 

Obama pushed aggressively for a ""smart electric grid,"" that could better manage electricity use. But a 2016 report from the Manhattan Institute finds that this push has also made the nation's power grid more vulnerable to cyberattack. ""The push for 'greener' and 'smarter' grids requires far greater grid-Internet connectivity to ensure the continuous delivery of electricity,"" notes the report's author, Mark Mills. ""These greener, smarter grids will involve a vast expansion of the Internet of Things that greatly increases the cyberattack surface available to malicious hackers and hostile nation-state entities.""

There’s speculation that this rapper was killed, by TPTB, for working on a documentary on Dr. Sebi; a man who claimed to have a cure for AIDs and promoted healthy wisdoms. In addition, the rapper was a strong black community member that worked on unification and renovation, so there’s always a possibility that he was killed because of it. There is also speculation that this rapper was killed due to gang violence. Personally, it’s hard to say anything for certain.

I never heard of him or his work until now, and I’m sure the evil elite wouldn’t want to draw attention to Dr. Sebi or the promotion of strong communities and unification. I’m sure they plan assassinations and they don’t just kill anyone because they “know” the truth or because they’re active community members. It raises too many questions, and as you can see it’s causing a lot of unwanted attention. 

Crazy pitch, but hear me out. When we use terms like the “elite”, I assume most of us think of a group that is made up of selfish, psychopathic people that want control and power over anyone who isn’t them. What if, there are other elites who actually do care for humanity and oppose the evil elitists? What if these two factions are the symbolic fight of Good vs Evil?

Now, what if this group sacrifices people, but it’s for the greater good? I was totally unaware of Dr. Sebi’s work, and it took this man’s life for me to become conscious of Dr. Sebi. This death is also promoting giving back to the community and unification. Is it possible that man was sacrificed by the “good” elite for these reasons? I mean, his family will be provided for; and I know, no amount of money can replace a father/husband, but they will be taken care of finically. 

This death also reminds me of that other rapper X, except he supposedly sold his soul. He has a song about making a deal with the devil. He promoted “Team Satan 666”. X was sacrificed (allegedly) too, but it was all about the money. I barely knew about the rapper until his death. His songs became the most streamed on multiple platforms. Imagine how much money his label got after. 

On a side note; I’m starting to see the logic in Trump supporters and Q. What if Trump is actually on our side and is working for the “good” elite? I still think it’s unlikely, but after thinking about it and writing this post I see how it’s possible to think that. 

Sorry if this post was all over the place, but the claims that Nipsey was killed by the “evil” elite didn’t make sense to me. As I said up above, there’s a lot of unwanted attention that is being generated. I also believe the elite run simulations with supercomputers before proceeding with anything so they can get an idea of what the most probable outcome is.

204,conspiracy,"TL;DR Trump is making a deal with Russia to sacrifice Mexico and Central America to an alien force bent on taking over the world.  

I’ve believed this for a long time, for some reason it just makes sense to me. Anyway, I also believe that he’s making some kind of deal with Russia (who’s in on all this with the aliens and might have some supervisory role to trump), to sacrifice the people living in Mexico and Central America. 

It’s an admittedly out there explanation for why he’s so obsessed with the border... however if people are fleeing Central America in massive numbers this alien invasion may be why. I’m not saying that there are spaceships in Guatemala right now; just that someone or some force is really trying hard to drive people north as fast as possible, and also why trump is enforcing border security with zero tolerance... it could be that the resistance to the aliens is coming from Central America somehow. 

Remember a border “shut down” is not a closure. It just means that every single person and thing is inspected... so maybe there is a reason he wants the extra scrutiny. 

It just somehow fits all these outsize reactions he has to things coming through the border that he can “see” and the rest of us can’t. Something keeps triggering him, hard - and he’s a strong willed individual. I can’t believe that any of his advisors are “triggering” his behavior, and I also can’t believe that he would consider himself less powerful than anyone else on earth... but against a superior alien force? I could see him definitely colluding/collaborating in that situation.

216,conspiracy,"Raymond ""Nels"" Nelson was from Rhode Island and a former bureau chief of the Providence Journal newspaper.  He became a DC Strategist when he helped then unknown Democratic politician Claiborne Pell (known for the College Pell Grants) become a US Senator.  After the election, he worked for Pell as an Administrative Assistant.  The married father of three's political rise would stall as he came out as gay in 1976.  His lifestyle was frowned upon by many in the DC establishment.  He did become a  staff member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.  In 1981 Nelson was found murdered in his residence on Quincey Street.  He had been beaten to death with one of his own typewriters.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some Friends of Nelson have an idea of a possible suspect but feel that political pressure has prevented an arrest.  Did Nelson know something he shouldn't have?   Was he involved in a relationship with someone powerful who was afraid that if it got out that it could damage their career?   Who and why was Raymond Nelson murdered?

How did I get the book ?:

&amp;#x200B;

Searching the internet, I found a topic here on this same subreddit, from two months ago, where one of the comments asked to get in touch with a man named Michael Weaver, since I do not live in the United States, I preferred to send an email, Michael replied quickly, this is his message:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Yes, I met Mr. Thomas in the 1960's when he was a guest on a talk radio show in Kansas City, Missouri.  At that time, the book he had that he brought with him and that I got a copy of was like a thirty page pamphlet, not really 'a book'.  I spent several hours conversing with Mr. Thomas and skimmed through his 'book' which I put away for safe keeping and then later lost in a flooded basement in the early '70's.*

*In the mid' 80's I began trying to find a copy, but to no avail.  I had been impressed with the description of a cataclysm - what Mr. Thomas called 'a tumble' but I could not well remember the details and was hoping to find a copy so I could better relate to others what he was explaining.  I contacted book stores near and far, but again, to no avail.  Sometime around the turn of the century, after I got 'interneted', I began searching again, and low and behold, a bookstore in England had a copy of a 'book' by Chan Thomas entitled 'The Adam And Eve Story'  I immediately ordered it, as was astounded when I received an actual paper back book of over two hundred pages, divided into two sections: The Adam and Eve Story, 127 pages and Aftermath of The Adam and Eve Story, 85 pages.  This book is a First Edition that was published by Bengal Tiger Press in 1993 and is much more comprehensive than the short pamphlet I had possessed those many years earlier.  I set about to cull from those over 200 pages the basic description of what a cataclysm is, and that small bit is what I posted on the blog that you must have read.  I recently had another person contact me, wanting the same info as you and I scanned the most of it into PDF file and sent to him, as I will for you.  Happy Reading...     Oh, and I don't know Anything about it ever having been 'classified info' though if it was, I guess it doesn't surprise me...  I'm not very good a computer stuff - I had difficulty in sending the last two sections - when you get it all put together, if there are pages missing or unreadable, let me know and I will try to make it right.  Glad to see the interest growing - so Please Share and keep Chan's works alive.  And keep me informed as you go along to what is happening with this amazing info.""*

237,conspiracy,"Regardless of your opinions on crustal displacement, we are seeing strong evidence of a pole reversal in current times. Moreover, we are seeing a correlation between rapid pole movement and the weakening of Earth's magnetic field, which is what protects us from a plethora of radiation and electromagnetic forces. This could be extremely dangerous for our species. Solar flares seem to be particularly dangerous during this period of weakened protection. 

Solar flares are measured by a series of numbers and letters. There are weaker solar storms than M or X class, but I'll be focusing on those for this comment. 

- M1 is fairly weak. 

- X1 is ten times stronger than M1.

- X10 is ten times stronger than X1 and 100 times stronger than M1.

- X100 is ten times stronger than X10, 100 times stronger than X1, and 1000 times stronger than M1.

Take the Carrington Event of 1859. It is estimated that this solar storm was anywhere from an X35-X45. Intense auroras were seen, the entire planet went without power for 12-24 hours, and the entirety of Earth's telegraph system was instantly fried. Telegraph operators actually suffered burns as a result of this event. It was a substantial solar storm, and the effects are obvious, but it would have been far worse by today's standards. In a time where all of your money is electronic, where virtually everyone's mode of transportation relies on one form of electricity or another, where communication and shelter rely on electricity, and the population of the world has fucktupled, we would be far worse off if struck by a similar storm. Luckily, when the Carrington Event happened, we had little reliance on electricity and a strong magnetic field. 

As recently as 50 years ago (heck, even 20 years ago), we were handling X-class solar flares with minimal to no disruption. Fast forward to the past decade, where we have seen a drastic acceleration of the poles shifting and a corresponding weakening of the magnetic field, and even storms as weak as M5-M9 have caused measurable ground and atmospheric disruption, such as transformers exploding, navigation technology going haywire causing the grounding of flights, strange weather patterns, and a variety of other electrical mishaps. In other words, weaker and weaker solar flares are having greater and greater effects on our planet and grid. 

If the trend of the weakening magnetosphere continues as the poles continue to shift, X-class solar flares could devastate our power grid and lead to a damn near apocalyptic scenario. No more food on shelves after 48 hours. Utter chaos in the streets. Governments would be unable to control the chaos as their tools for doing so would be reduced to analog technology. These are just the immediate dangers. Radiation would seep into our atmosphere and undoubtably affect us and the wildlife in ways that are difficult to predict. Billions would die. 

Couple this with the periodic rise and fall of activity in our sun. Our sun's magnetosphere offers us protection as well. Right now the sun's magnetosphere is also seeing a declining trend. Moreover, within the next couple generations our solar system is expected to move out of a magnetically charged cloud of dust that is also offering us protection. It's like a trifecta of weakening protections threatening to plunge us into more cosmic radiation than our species has ever known. Absolutely crazy shit. 

A great source to get you started. Entire channel is constantly researching this topic.

There are a lot of theories about the next mass extinction event, what will cause it, and how urgent it is. Some will tell you climate change, others will say general pollution and overpopulation, some will say nuclear war, some will say crazy huge asteroid colliding with earth. Personally, I put my stock in the pole shift and consequent weakening of our magnetic field. It seems the most urgent as we are *currently experiencing the beginning of the flip,* and the effects are already being measured.

241,conspiracy,"Yesterday I got high on some stimualnts and somehow got into a conversation with a buddy about artist now a days popping up over night, mainly rap but stuff surrounding today's music is odd. Then again maybe we were just high but either way it's a pretty wild and interesting threoy I came up with. Bear with me its alot to take in so lol. Okay 2000s music was in my opinion very good and different then alot of other, between 2000-2013 is about where I gonna say this is, anyways everything was equally on the radio and flavored people's type they listened too and it was all good and felt like everyone in America had a song they liked and I'm talking mostly Country, Rap, Rock, Pop and a short but out of nowhere dubstep wave that died. Okay here's when stuff got different but I dont think most people really realized it. After dubstep fell out completely around 2015, rap all of sudden became hugley diverse almost overnight and soon enough everyone started creating it, mainly pop stars like rihanna, Beyonce, never heard rock, county, ect and when I say that I main yeah it was around but you had to search around if you wanted to hear new stuff, wasn't really openly advertised or talked about as much. So back to the rap, overnight you had not only the whole country slowly becoming a fan towards American rap music but the world. Rap mutanted into subgroups like trap, emo, club, banger, styles of rapping, openly gay rappers, gangster, screamo, dance mixed rap verses with pop hooks, politically, odd, just plain stupid (long neck) and all kinds of white rappers were slowing taking over in areas. Now here was what I think was a big change that was planned, ""Mumble rap"" came out which was literally just saying slangs and popular things the kids were saying but in fact where obviously violent , drug, crime and so on along with face tattoos becoming a fad with everyone...this is not good. Around that time...that's when alot of shootings were happening and they've always have but America would unknowingly start to expect these shootings and become a normal thing like a car wreck and there young people are manily the victims with all the same stuff, doing rap, face tattoos and ect but no one really said anything cause it was brainwashing EVERYONE. Look at it like this, lil pumps lyrics are not good and are just mouth sounds and drug,gun related stuff but his and other artsits songs where somehow In commericals, hollywood movies, advertised through numerous products, memes, soical media, I could go on and even people who didn't even like it eventually started singing the songs under their breath, there catchy and beats we're becoming as popular as the slang, GANG GANG, SKIIIRRRRT, FUCK 12, ON GOD, ect. 
Ok now this how I believe shit got out fast and when I came up with this main theroy
I'm pretty sure you heard of a Industry Plant
I haven't before this 
Well if ya don't a Industry Plant is a Artist of entertainment that the government or whoever (Illuminati) payed or sold their soul for instant fame to pull in more fans however they do It, whether it be a hot female, emo rapper, disability or whatever someone could connect with. Okay so I thought of baby goth. Shes a new rap artist with face tattoos and is assiocated with others just like her. Well Dou Re Me Fa So..a song I've heard everywhere for weeks before I even know who baby goth was was this girls song and no where do I remember hearing by baby goth or baby goths new song check it out. It was like they used sublimated messageing by playing it but never really openly said who sung it. So I did some research on baby goth and her being asccused of a Industry Plant was first to  come up but not only that, but not really any info or pics was anywhere about her. Its like if someone bought a random girl where ever they found her, sat her down whoever she was and offered a deal....fame, money, everything you want like most humans. Only thing is your born again, new name, new person. Now you have baby goth I fresh rap artist who can relate to all kinds but has face tattoos, lyrics with drugs and satanism overlays but everybody from teachers to kids to seniors wouldn't even point it out but would often say I like her she's different or I like the beat and I think it's caused this plan of music weaponry through brain washing for years though media and entertainment and basically what everyone does now a days through there phone has worked. Don't know why, maybe it's to shape and form a generation or make violence more accepted or crime and drugs to be a cool thing to get more control of something. I dont know there's a million reasons or like I said maybe I'm just high and sound hella crazy 😀😆

Was Abdelsoud a CIA agent all along?

Sorry for the formatting, it's from a pdf..

""Zawahiri's guide in the  United  States was a singular figure in  the  history  of  espionage, Ali  Abdelsoud  Mohammed.  Six-foot-one,  two  hundred  pounds,  and  exceptionally  fit,  Mohammed  was  a  martial artist  and  a  skilled  linguist  who  spoke  fluent  English,  French,  and  Hebrew  in  addition  to his native  Arabic. When the Egyptian Army cashiered him, Zawahiri gave him the daunting task of penetrating American intelligence.

 In 1984 Mohammed boldly walked into the Cairo station of the CIA to  offer  his  services. The  officer  who  assessed  him  decided  he  was  probably  a plant  by  Egyptian intelligence; however,  he  cabled  other  stations and headquarters  to see if there was any interest.  The Frank-furt  station, which hosted  the Iranian office  of the  agency,  responded,  and soon Ali found  himself in Hamburg  as a novice intelligence man. He entered  a mosque associated with Hezbollah and immediately  told  the  Iranian cleric in charge that he was an American  spy assigned to infiltrate  the community.  He didn't  realize that the agency had already penetrated  the mosque; his declaration was immediately  reported.  

The  CIA says that it terminated  Mohammed,  sent out  cables label-ing  him  highly untrustworthy,  and  placed  him  on  the  State  Depart-ment watch list to prevent him from entering the United  States. By that time, however, Mohammed was already in California on a visa-waiver program  that  was  sponsored  by  the  agency  itself,  one  designed  to  shield  valuable  assets or  those  who  have  performed  important  ser-vices  for  the  country.  In order  to  stay in  the  United  States, he  would  need  to  become  a  citizen,  so he  married  a  California  woman,  Linda  Sanchez, a medical technician, whom  he met on the transatlantic flight to the United States. A year after  Mohammed  arrived, he returned  to his military career, this time as an enlisted man in the  U.S. Army. He managed to get sta-tioned  at  the  John  F. Kennedy  Special Warfare  Center  and  School at Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina.  Even  though  he  was  only  a  supply  sergeant, Mohammed  made  a remarkable  impression, gaining a spe-cial commendation  from his commanding officer  ""for exceptional  per-formance"" and winning fitness awards in competition  against some of the  most  highly  trained  soldiers  in  the  world.  His  awed  superiors  found  him ""beyond reproach"" and ""consistently accomplished."" Perhaps  the  secret  to  preserving  his  double  identity  was  that  he  The Silicon  Valley  never  disguised  his  beliefs.  He  began  each  morning  with  dawn  prayers, followed by a long run while listening on his Walkman  to  the  Quran, which he was trying to memorize. He cooked his own meals to make sure they  followed  Islamic dietary rules. In addition  to his mili-tary duties, he was pursuing a doctorate  in Islamic studies. The Amer-ican army was so respectful  of his views that it asked him to help teach a  class  on  Middle  East politics  and  culture  and  to  make  a  series of videotapes  explaining  Islam  to  his  fellow  soldiers.  According  to  Mohammed's  service  records,  he  ""prepared  and  executed  over  40  country  orientations  for  teams  deploying to  the  Middle East/'  Mean-time, he was slipping maps and training manuals off base to downsize and copy at Kinko's. He used these  to write the multivolume  terrorist  training  guide  that  became  al-Qaeda's  playbook.  

On  weekends  he  commuted to Brooklyn and Jersey City, where he trained Muslim mili-tants  in  military  tactics.  Among  them  were  members   of  al-Jihad,  including el-Sayyid  Nosair, a  fellow  Egyptian who  would  kill Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Jewish extremist, in 1990. In  1988 Mohammed  casually informed  his superior  officers that he was  taking  some  leave  time  to  go  ""kill  Russians"" in  Afghanistan.  When he came back, he showed  off a couple  of belt buckles he said he . took  from  Soviet  soldiers he  killed  in  ambush.  In  fact,  he  had  been  training the  first al-Qaeda volunteers in techniques  of  unconventional  warfare, including kidnappings, assassinations, and hijacking planes, which he had learned from  the American Special Forces. Mohammed  left  active military service in  1989 and joined the U.S. Army  Reserve. He and his wife  settled  in the  Silicon Valley 

He  man-aged to hold a job as a security guard (for a defense contractor that was developing a triggering device for the Trident missile system) despite the fact that he sometimes disappeared  for months, ostensibly to  ""buy  rugs""  in  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan.  Meanwhile,  he  continued  his  attempts to penetrate American intelligence. He had applied  for a posi-tion as a translator at both the CIA and the FBI while in North Carolina. Then  in  May  1993, an  FBI agent  in  San  Jose  named  John  Zent  approached  Mohammed,  inquiring  about  the  trade  in  fake  driver's  licenses.  Still  hoping   to   get   recruited   by  American  intelligence,  

Mohammed  steered  the  conversation  toward  radical  activities  in  a  local  mosque,  and  he  told  some  eye-opening  tales  about  fighting  the  Soviets  in  Afghanistan.  Because  of  the  military  nature  of  these  revelations, Zent  contacted  the  Department of Defense, and a team of 181  counterintelligence  specialists  from  Fort  Meade,  Maryland,  came  to  San Jose to talk to Mohammed.  They spread  out  maps  of Afghanistan on the floor of Zent's office, and Mohammed  indicated the  mujahideen  training  camps. 

 He  mentioned  the  name  of  Osama  bin  Laden,  who  Mohammed   said  was  preparing  an  army  to  knock  off  the  Saudi  regime.  Mohammed   also  spoke  about   an  organization,  al-Qaeda,  which was operating training camps in Sudan. He even admitted  that  he was providing the members instruction  in hijacking and espionage. The  interrogators  apparently  made  nothing  of  these  revelations.  It  would  be  three  critical years before  anyone  else in American  intelli-gence would  hear of al-Qaeda.""","Ignorance, or collusion?"

Westminster was built nearby with the purpose of competing with the powerful City of London and this was when the second London was born. The new city expanded rapidly and it eventually surrounded the City of London. By 1889 the County of London was formed and the name was more often used for the larger area that surrounded the original City of London.

The City of London continued functioning independently, governed by a Corporation even after 1965, when the County of London and the County of Middlesex were abolished and Greater London was formed. The mayor of Greater London has nothing to do with the original City of London, which still has separate governing bodies and a mayor.

In fact, the City of London is so independent that it has its own flag, crest, police force, ceremonial armed forces, and a mayor who has a special title, the Right Honorable, the Lord Mayor of London. Oddly enough, if the monarch wants to enter the City of London, she first must ask the Lord Mayor for permission.

This  interview with David Berkowitz (Son of Sam, and also includes some very interesting opinions of Police investigators) seems to finally explain the baffling actions of that  man. It certainly has made me think there is some truth to his claims. I  tried to read up on this case and bits and pieces seem to be consistent  with what he is saying. He claims the SOS murders were the result of  several people, and the witness statements really do vary hugely and imply more than one person. He doesn't deny  responsibility and says he deserves to be locked up forever. He says even though he was involved in some killings he was to take the heat for a cult called The Process that was mainly responsible for these killings. He mentions that The Process had animal sacrifices  at a particular park, of German Shepherds. This is true, there were  mutilated dogs of that type found at the park where they were based, and  The Process Church has admitted to focusing on this animal, but they say, in a loving way. David famously originally claimed that a  neighbours dog told him to kill people.

Animal sacrifices (German Shepherds, the worshiped dogs of The Process) in Untermyer Park -  [https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ritualistic-sacrifice-and-the-son-of-sam-satan-worshiping-in-america-s-greatest-forgotten-garden](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ritualistic-sacrifice-and-the-son-of-sam-satan-worshiping-in-america-s-greatest-forgotten-garden)

What people may not  realise, is that the owner of David Berkowitz's next door dog does seem was a member of a cult, which seems to have been The Process as Berkowitz says so ( see [here](https://unsolved.com/gallery/son-of-sam/) and [here](https://forums.sherdog.com/threads/did-the-son-of-sam-really-act-alone-or-was-he-a-member-of-a-murderous-satanic-cult.3749461/page-3) ) and that he owned a distinctive yellow car matching one ID'd as moving fast away from one of the SOS killings. 

The Process cult originated in a rich suburb of London. It has apparently changed its identity. More oddities (my observation) - the Process used a very similar symbol to the Zodiac killers symbol on their literature, and I recall also that version was used in one image, also he was never caught, and the MO and targets of The Zodiac looks similar to David Berkowitz - Young healthy people and couples are senselessly targeted. The Process changed identity and moved  from the west coast allegedly eastwards and as they moved east, it has  been speculated they could tie in with other killers.

They have since disappeared without trace, except the female founder established an animal sanctuary in Utah, but are believed by some to have set up under a new identity.

For some more info on the SOS cultlink, this is 

Although tenuous, I believe there could be connections with other unsolved murders. The so-called  'Smiley Face' killer was a hypothesised serial killer that similarly  targets young, cream of the crop type students who were disposed in rivers and lakes. Certain indications are that most of those deaths,  occurring along the Interstate 94 corridor around the Great Lakes, are not natural and do seem to be murders, though once a drunk person goes missing, and later turns up in the water, it will almost always be  presumed as accidental. There is a detailed analysis by an ex cop and a  university criminologist called Case Studies in Drowning Forensics that  builds a strong case for the unnatural nature and demographics of these  deaths. And they support that this was likely the work of a group. At many of the deaths strange 'smiley face' graffiti was often found.  Whilst likely a coincidence, the retire Police officers who took up the  case on behalf of the parents states that the smiley faces they  identified at the hypothesised dumping points were not alike, were distinctive and are tags of specific gangs. One of the smiley faces has a  Zodiac style cross on the forehead, and, this cross was also carved into Charles Mansons forehead before he later converted it into a swastika. Charles Manson also appears to have connections to The Process, two members of which apparently visited him in Jail, after which Charles made an abrupt change in some of the things he was saying. A very loose connection therefore can be made between the symbols used by Manson and the Zodiac, and the claimed visitors of Manson in jail, The Process.

Although a few of the Smiley Face victims show definite signs of murder, the use of a drug like GHB or Scopolamine was not tested, except when the test was  specifically requested by the authors of Drowning Forensics, they then did indeed show suspicious levels of GHB.

It has been  suggested that slightly inebriated men had either their drinks spiked,  or were lured perhaps with women into a van, later drugged, perhaps  killed in a bath tub, and dumped in rivers. It appears to be the result of a group, which suggests a cult.

The forensic  evidence for these deaths include the fact that all are of a specific  age group, where, based on the demographics of alcohol drinkers, only  26% should be. The fact that most of these deaths occur in the winter,  spring and autumn, which is very rare, few people lark about on the  water except in the summer; in some cases they come from the same town  and frequented the same bars; the bodies turned up in the water floating face up, but nearly all males float face down after any length of time  according to the texts, which suggests they have been moved from land  after death, ligature marks on the neck, empty hands whereas natural  drownings the hands often are clutching weeds and show certain injuries  from thrashing, rigor mortis which always passes after a few days, yet  these men are going missing 2-3 weeks prior, and show virtually no  degradation, fly larvae that are of a house fly species and only lay on  land, the GHB and more besides. One victim was last seen staggering down  the road being followed by a car which stopped everytime the victim  staggered, which several witnesses reported as very suspicious.

Something similar may be happening in the UK. There are now 60 young  men, and it is exclusively men, pulled out of Manchester canals in the  last few years. Parents consider the deaths suspicious and have dubbed  the speculated killer as the Manchester Pusher. Police have not  supported these claims in any way and have not apparently even  considered it seriously.

# Let Us Prepare For The Climate Challenges We Face

Through years of research I have concluded with empirical evidence that we as a society have been lied to about the very nature of our being, the planet, the solar system, and the universe as a whole. In other words life as we know it is a 100% agenda driven folly. Our intellect and general understanding of things have been manipulated by subversive forces for hundreds of years.

The data consolidated within this report will most assuredly not be taken lightly by the masses and will most likely be shunned by many. Let it be shown that this is at what level of ignorance society has fallen. As Henry Ford said so eloquently, a society of ""functioning illiterates"".

The following are cycles of life that cannot be avoided. These cycles are not fully understood with regard to how, when, where and why by modern science. In this thesis we will discuss the life giving cycles of the sun and it's effect on mankind, the planet, and the solar system, finally showing how the sun reacts to the surrounding universe and it's inhabitants.

I will discuss how society can prepare for these cycles through the knowledge of the ancients using historical evidence of the past as a source of looking into the future and knowing what markers to look for. Understanding these records is of the utmost importance if we are to prepare for the future. The correct planning and preparation will give mankind a higher percentage of survivability during these natural, cyclical, challenging times ahead of us.

The sun, giver of life, was the focal point of many ancient culture structures. We find this evident in the inscriptions left behind on tablets, precious metal, wood, stone, papyrus, clay pots and figurines. They planned everyday of their lives according to the disposition of the sacred solar disk. This allowed them to plan for the future as they understood the cycles of the sun.

Through hundreds of years of study they understood with certainty that the sun went through changes and subsequently presented them with challenges on a cyclical timeline. They kept records and understood that by looking at the past they could prepare for future events.

On a mundane level the sun has an 11yr cycle of high and low sunspot activity. It is recorded that while the sun is at it's minimum point there are more natural disruptions on the planet that ultimately affect our daily lives. This rather mundane 11yr cycle exists within longer cycles that can last for up to thousands of years. We have no idea how far out this long count goes. What we do know is that according to written texts of the last 3000 years the sun has also gone into longer states of minimum (minimum solar sun spots) that lasts for decades at fluctuating times. These are called Grand Solar Minimum periods. The mundane 11yr cycle (MC) is within this Grand Solar Minimum cycle (GSM).

As we glean information from the historical record we see GSM's occur cyclically, roughly every 100+- years with every fourth GSM being of longer duration than the others, thus creating another 400yr cycle.

When we consider the 25,772 year procession of the equinoxes, which coincidentally aligns with the Mayan calendar, we can draw a panorama of cyclical patterns of endless timelines. With this understanding it would be easy to now hypothesize that there are massive universal cycles at play here. All of which affect life on our planet.

To help the reader wrap ones head around this I have included graphs linked below which  will help to illustrate the science.

\#1/ Here is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:SpaceEnvironmentOverview_From_19830101.jpg), notice the top of the graph how it shows the rounding scale of the mundane 11yr cycle.

\#2/ This [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Sunspots_11000_years.svg) gives us almost 12k years of sunspot activity. Notice how thousands of years ago the sun was much more active and that we are without a doubt sliding downward as we enter the 21st century.

\#3/ Here is another [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Solar_Cycle_Prediction.gif) showing the mundane 11yr cycle and how this 24th cycle we currently reside, there are fewer sunspots than previous cycles and the same downward trend indicated in the previous graph. (update 3/30/2019, we are now headed upward into solar cycle 25. Predictably there should be an increase in sunspot activity for the next 5 1/2 years until we turn downward once again. It is predicted that SC 25 will not exceed in solar activity compared to previous cycles. It is thought that it will indeed be greatly diminished allowing even more comic ray flux bombardment. Looking to the future, SC 26 remains to be seen yet is predicted with of even lower sunspot activity than SC 25, up to a possible complete shutdown (no sunspot activity for a prolonged, unknown period of time). We will enter this uncharted territory by 2030. This is what mankind needs to prepare for).

\#4/ Here is a great [snapshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Sunspot_Numbers.png) of our current status to the right showing in detail the 11yr MC within the longer GSM cycles dating back 400 years.

This period is known as the [little ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age).

\#5/ Here is a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum#/media/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png) of the Holocene period we are currently experiencing. This period in which we are residing is very rare when seen through the eyes of modern man. The graphs and information on [this page](http://www.dandebat.dk/eng-klima7.htm) will arouse serious contemplation for the reader. Notice graphs 3-4-5 down the page. I will touch more on this later.

GSM's are cycles of the sun at minimum sunspot activity for longer periods of time that produce extreme weather conditions on earth that ultimately lead to global cooling up to the point of glaciation. In other words, this is how, when, where and why an ice age occurs. The signs to look for during a GSM cycle is extreme weather changes.

Examples of extreme weather are prolonged freezing temperatures, earthquakes, volcanism, heavy rains, sever flooding, hurricanes, tornado's, jet stream realignment, etc. These natural occurrences lead to crop loss and food shortages. Add to this wild animal extinction level die-off, disease and reduction in population.

It is recorded that when these GSMs occur, civilizations fall. Many Chinese dynasties have fallen during a GSM cycle due to the lack of food. The people's growing discontent of current rulership forces change. This fact is actually written in the Chinese record dating back over 4000 years.

When the sun is in minimum there are fewer sunspots. Fewer sunspots affect the planet in ways that cause earth to reduce it's [already diminished](https://www.tttruth.com/the-truth-about-earths-degrading-protection-layer/) protective magnetosphere layer which ultimately allows more [cosmic ray flux](https://www.space.com/32644-cosmic-rays.html) into the planet.

This cosmic high energy radiation is mysteriously formed outside the solar system. One resulting effect cosmic radiation flux has is, it heats up the earth's core liquefying the mantle which causes earthquakes and volcanism. The loosening of the mantle allows the earth's tectonic plates to move more easily. The increased volcanism spews ash into the atmosphere creating a blanket that reflects the suns radiation back into space therefore producing a cooling effect on a global scale. An ice age of sorts sets in.

The ancients knew the cause and effect of this natural cycle. It is believed they were actually trying to warn future civilizations of this very event that historically occurred over and over again. As stated before their warnings are in their writings on walls, tablets, paintings, pottery, etc. The Mayan calendar is the perfect example of a GSM timetable.

We are in the 21st century and the common person has no idea of these cyclical events. These natural cycles were common knowledge amongst our ancient ancestors.

In gradeschool, highschool, even at college level this information is not taught and I believe it is purposefully hidden from the general population. Even modern day scientists don't talk about this. I should say ""funded"" modern day scientists.

Man-made global warming, we constantly hear about it all over the macro news outlets how man is causing the earth to heat up due to increased Co2 levels and if we don't stop our way of life we will all fry.

This could not be further from the truth. Science does not back this up. Independent scientists have proven without a doubt that [temperature does not follow Co2 increases](https://cornwallalliance.org/2017/06/global-temperature-and-co2-which-drives-which/). The current models are seriously flawed.

What science does back up is the fact that the earth temperature runs in cycles, always has, always will. It is recorded that we are currently in a very easy, steady  temperature period called the [holocene](https://www.livescience.com/28219-holocene-epoch.html) of the last 11,400 years. Before this period dating back to the previous warm period between 115k and 130k years ago, the earth had seen wild temperature fluctuations.

This current holocene period is the only reason why we are here today as we are. Dating back 7k years the Nile dwellers started to farm and domesticate animals, only because of constant warm weather. There were no anthropogenic causes for this warm period.

All current data, looking at sunspots, knowing the cyclical output of the sun, recognizing all the severe weather, it is determined we are descending into what is called the Modern Grand Solar Minimum. There will be no global warming, there will be cooling. I emphatically state that in 2012 we started our decent with the aforementioned weather effects gaining traction and moving rapidly to where we are today.

In a book written in 1977 by Ervin Laszlo et al. entitled [Goals for Mankind](https://www.amazon.com/Goals-Mankind-Report-Club-Rome/dp/0525034552), A Report to the Club of Rome on the New Horizons of Global Community- in chapter 13 labeled Global Food Goals, these scientists discuss the impending ice-age and the resulting food shortages.

They knew about this in 1977.

Recently, starting with the year 2017 we saw unprecedented sever weather on all fronts. [Hurricane after hurricane](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/09/23/harvey-irma-maria-why-is-this-hurricane-season-so-bad/?utm_term=.7de00841334c)producing billions of dollars worth of damage and human loss. Sever flooding globally.

An [uptick in earthquakes](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/#%7B%22autoUpdate%22%3A%5B%22autoUpdate%22%5D%2C%22basemap%22%3A%22grayscale%22%2C%22feed%22%3A%227day_m45%22%2C%22listFormat%22%3A%22default%22%2C%22mapposition%22%3A%5B%5B-86.35757936849899%2C-315%5D%2C%5B86.35) measuring 4.0 or greater with massive amounts of lives lost, again globally. [Volcanism uptick](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/) on a global scale producing massive ash clouds blanketing the atmosphere. This will lead to [massive animal die-offs](http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/animal-deaths-birds-fish-end-times.html) and crop reduction.

As we slide further and further into the Modern GSM things will get increasingly worse and there are nearly 8 billion people on this planet that all need to eat.

We have established the fact that the sun changes constantly and that it runs in cycles of increased and diminished output. We have also established that these ""down"" cycles have an ill effect upon our globe and consequently it's inhabitants. We have determined that without doubt, with all of our understanding, the sun is shutting down. The signs are there. The science is there.

If the earth changes are due to the sun cycles and resulting increase of cosmic ray flux, I think it only prudent to ask, is something affecting the sun also?

I leave this discussion for another time.

For now, mankind must learn modern survival techniques. One must delve into study regarding self preservation in this modern age. We must learn how to prepare and fend for ones self and family lest you be waiting in a long line for your daily handout of food from the government that will undoubtedly not be nutritious. Everything we take for granted in our modern world will become a luxury. Running water, nutritious food, automobiles, electricity, work, toilet paper, soap, peace of mind and the list goes on.

With all this hard data and some speculation, I conclude something within our society is amiss and that history was purposefully hidden from us. We are on our own. Do not wait for your government to sound the alarm. It will either never come or it will be too late, by design. 

To delve further into this topic I will leave you with a few websites that will provide the truth in your discovery.

[The Watchers](https://watchers.news/) this is the only global weather channel you'll ever need for truth.

[Principia Scientific International](https://principia-scientific.org/) is the one stop source for unlimited, uncorrupted scientific weather data. They also discuss the problems with consensus science.  

Here are links to some people who I feel are a good source of information to help you understand and prepare for the coming GSM.

[Oppenheimer Ranch Project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6VhLE7qAeW8NZm6PsXGGrQ) / Diamond, a paleo-climatologist by trade is building a self sustaining habitat in Colorado. He reports on the GSM with hard data and history to provide easy understanding. This is done on a daily basis. Diamond is a crackup with a great sense of humor albeit a bit on the edgy side. Works for me.

[Adapt 2030](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-5dIHmtQzHIdNCs7-bEdCA) / David Dubyne is putting all this into layman's terms and has many video files for reference on the GSM and how it affects crop output. David also has a keen outlook on crypto currencies and how they may play a leading monetary role during this GSM cycle. He documents on youtube multiple times per week with short to the point videos.

327,conspiracy,"We're about to have a criminal trial for a police officer who shot and killed a woman who actually called the police to report what she thought might be a crime.  

Justine Ruszcyk (often referred to Justine Damond, I forget which was her maiden name) lived in a prosperous, white and liberal neighborhood in Minneapolis and called the police to report what she thought might have been a rape or an assault.  When the police were driving down her alley, she hit their car to get their attention and the officer in the passenger seat, Mohamed Noor, fired across his partner's chest and killed the unarmed Justine who was described as being in a t-shirt and yoga pants.

The entire incident has been full of apparently conspiratorial elements.  Neither of the two officers had their body cameras turned on, in violation of department policy.  Justine was unarmed, and the neighborhood (I've lived in Minneapolis my whole life, most of it within a couple of miles of the scene) has near zero crime.  Noor wouldn't speak to investigators (admittedly his right as a potential criminal defendant).

It was reported that Noor was hired as part of city ""Fast Track"" program, designed to get more unconventional background people into the police force.  There's been some controversy about what this program means.  One interpretation is that it's about weakening the requirements to get more minorities on the force, a competing one is that Fast Track candidates get the same police training, they just get some kind of academic credit for having something other than the standard community college ""criminal justice"" degree.

It's taken forever to get a trial for Noor, almost two years since the incident occurred.  The conventional explanation is that there were no witnesses except Noor and his partner.  Noor isn't talking and while his partner made a statement, I think it was limited due to his own culpability.  The County Attorney who previously had chosen *not* to use a grand jury in another officer involved shooting (a major shift in policy), changed gears and went back to the grand jury to compel testimony from people involved with the police force and Noor.

All along it's felt like everyone involved, despite being on the opposite sides of a lot of political and criminal justice issues, has something invested in this issue being brushed under the rug.  The cops don't want to be prosecuted for shooting people under any circumstances.  The County Attorney doesn't want to aggressively pursue police prosecutions because he works with and depends on cops to make cases.  The city political officials who backed the Fast Track program as a way to improve police/minority relations by improving its diversity don't want to be held responsible for potentially getting a woman killed when one of their program's star pupils apparently panicked, nor do they want the related idea that Somalis or minorities are less qualified.

The African American community doesn't want to deal with this -- while usually on the receiving end of police violence by white cops, they see hypocrisy in prosecuting a black cop for killing a white woman when white cops who kill blacks don't get prosecuted.  Even more divisive, though, is that there's not a lot of love lost between the ""native"" African American community and the large Somali community.

Even the trial is starting to feel weird and compromised.  The presiding judge has [moved the trial to a small courtroom, officially limiting how many members of the media and family members can attend](http://www.startribune.com/judge-restricts-media-public-s-access-to-noor-murder-trial/507810372/), has [refused the media's requests for electronic recording/filming](https://kstp.com/news/judge-rules-cameras-not-allowed-courtroom-trial-former-minneapolis-police-officer-mohamed-noor/5258211/), and is now [restricting what evidence can even be shown to the gallery \(and thus media\)](http://www.startribune.com/attorneys-judge-to-address-final-details-in-upcoming-noor-trial/507825992/).

The entire case seems to compromise nearly anyone who is related to it -- cops, prosecutors, blacks, politicians.  Minneapolis is also a one-party town, totally controlled by the Democratic party, including the county prosecutor.  The people with the most to lose here seem to be people related to the Democrats, since Fast Track was their policy and they run the city government.

Ironically, the police seem to be the ones with something to gain, even if their former officer is convicted.  They can argue Fast Track was a bad idea, cops should come from the programs/backgrounds they've always come from and that rushing minorities into the force is a bad idea.  Plus this lets them run a pesky immigrant minority out of the force (he has already been fired, though its not hard to see him suing to get his job back if he wins a not guilty verdict).

348,conspiracy,"Theoretically, Democrats could impeach Trump for colluding with Jews and Israel. They won’t do that because all the top Democrats in political power are guilty of doing the same thing.

None of us are surprised that Donald Trump adopted a pro-Israel foreign policy. While not emphasized during his 2016 presidential campaign, it was certainly a part of his platform. We have a political situation in the United States where it is currently impossible for anybody to win the presidency without having a pro-Israel foreign policy stance. It is especially true with the Republicans.

The Jew-run media plays a role yes, but it is also because the Republican Party has a base of idiotic Christian Zionists who falsely believe that Jews are the chosen people of God. Many of them believe in this weird end times bullshit, thinking that they’ll be raptured into heaven prior to a biblical apocalypse. Naturally, all of this is centered around events in Israel. These deranged people saw the establishment of Israel in 1948 as a sign that Jesus was about to return and that the end times as told in the Book of Revelation was right around the corner.

Many of us were willing to begrudgingly accept a continued pro-Israel foreign policy so long as the “Make America Great Again” agenda was implemented. That’s because the domestic affairs of the United States are an immediate priority, the most important issue being immigration and the changing racial demographics of the country. What’s happening on the other side of the world with Zionist Jews slaughtering Palestinians is not a top-shelf priority.

Unfortunately, what we’ve gotten is very little of the MAGA agenda while Israel has gotten all if not more than they could have ever asked for. Here’s a list I compiled from a previous article along with a few additions.

Recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel.
Recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the American embassy there.
Provided billions of dollars in foreign aid to Israel.
Cut foreign aid to the Palestinians.
Completely cut all formal relations with Palestine.
Attacked Syria twice over fake gas attack footage.
Criticized Ilhan Omar as an anti-Semite for saying that the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC exists.
Spent a good part of his recent State of the Union speech reminding people of the Jewish Holocaust hoax.
Established a major arms deal to Saudi Arabia to help counter Iran, Israel’s main regional enemy.
Implemented sanctions on Iran and pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal.
Consistently defended Israel at the United Nations.

RT also did a segment on the recently held AIPAC conference making similar observations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GUyADPUJnQ

The fact that Trump has done more for Israel than the Americans who voted him into office is reason enough for Congress to justify filing articles of impeachment.

It’s also worth noting that Trump is surrounded by Jews and a variety of people who have pledged their allegiance to Israel. His Jew son-in-law Jared Kushner is the most obvious example, but it isn’t just him. All we have to do is take a look at the recent AIPAC conference.

Vice President Mike Pence delivered a deranged speech bragging about how much they’ve done for Israel. He comically claimed that doing all of these things for Israel was somehow in the best interest of the United States even though it obviously is not.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u2WKAI4luw

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also delivered a speech where he talked about how it was such a great honor for him to have visited Israel. He described anti-Zionism as being anti-Semitism while making a number of other very bizarre statements.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jspOyaxkXYk

Under normal circumstances, it would be quite concerning to see the top political leadership of the United States focusing their energy on advancing the interests of a foreign country. In fact, it would be grounds for immediate impeachment. Many Democrats admit that this is absolutely a basis for impeachment. All you have to do is look at how seriously they took the conspiracy theory that Trump secretly colluded with Russia in order to win the 2016 presidential election. The whole thing might have been a big hoax, but it showed that they believe it is a big problem if a foreign country tries to interfere in our political system.

Despite all that, there is no talk from Democrats about Trump colluding with Israel or demanding his impeachment over this. And that’s because the top leadership of the Democrat Party is also colluding with Jews and Israel.

The Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke at AIPAC and professed how much she and the Democrat Party is doing for Israel.

House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer also delivered an AIPAC speech. Like Schumer, he has made previous speeches at AIPAC. Hoyer basically tells the Jews in attendance that he is a very good goy and that he loves Israel.

So even though Trump could theoretically be impeached for colluding with Israel, he won’t be because the top Democrat leaders in Congress are guilty of doing the same thing. They’re all pushing an “Israel First” agenda.

It’s no wonder why Ilhan Omar took so much heat for simply mentioning that AIPAC exists. She exposed how both political parties are controlled by Jews and how they put the interests of Israel above the interests of America.",Trump Could Be Legitimately Impeached for Colluding With Jews and Israel

**edit:** adding for visibility since it was a great comment

&gt;List of some of the fluoridation accidents and ""overfeeds"" causing fluoride spikes in drinking water going back to the 1970s. Keep in mind this is only when somebody noticed and they knew the culprit was fluoride: https://fluoridealert.org/content/recent-fluoridation-related-accidents/

&gt;2019 – Sandy, Utah: A snowstorm led to a fluoridation overfeed that resulted in high fluoride concentrations dissolving piping leading to elevated levels of manganese, aluminum, iron, arsenic, copper, &amp; lead. Babies &amp; pregnant women among those sickened as reported in news which estimates 3k homes and several schools affected. Slow city response.

&gt;2018 – Hanover County, North Carolina: NEW HANOVER COUNTY —Fluoride was detected at double the federal limit early this morning in the public water supply in New Hanover County, but the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority has no answers for how it happened. In at least one location north of Wilmington, Cape Fear Public Utility Authority tested a sample at 8 milligrams per liter before 5 a.m. this morning, according to North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Regional Engineering Supervisor Hedi Cox. The federal maximum amount of fluoride allowed in public water systems is 4.0 milligrams per liter. The recommended guideline for the Environmental Protection Agency is 2.0 milligrams per liter [but the new goal is supposed to be 0.7mg/l]. Despite issuing a “do not drink” advisory to nearly 30,000 customers due to an “abundance of fluoride” in the water, CFPUA has been unable to offer an answer to the question on everyone’s mind: How long have the levels been elevated?

&gt;2018 – Franklin, Pennsylvania: Franklin General Authority members unanimously voted Tuesday to terminate fluoride services within the city’s water system. The vote followed an incident in February when elevated levels of the acidic chemical were discovered in some residents’ water in the Third Ward, Oak Hill and Rocky Grove areas. Residents went without drinkable water for several weeks after city crews found an equipment malfunction at Barrett Flats had allowed a surplus amount of fluoride into the system…

&gt;2012 – Kalamazoo, Michigan: An overfeed of fluoridation chemicals to the drinking water occurred and residents were not notified for 6 months. Representatives of the water facility say a fluoridation overfeed also occurred in 2006.

&gt;2011 – Mount Airy, North Carolina: A valve malfunction caused an overfeed of fluoridation chemicals into the drinking water for residents and three schools.

&gt;2010 – Asheboro, North Carolina: Mechanical error at water treatment plant caused overfeed of fluoridation chemicals into the drinking water system of over 220 households. 60 gallons of the chemical was released at once, rather than over a 24-hour period as expected.

&gt;2009 – Brisbane, Australia: Equipment malfunction at water treatment plant caused massive overfeed of fluoridation chemicals, increasing the levels to 30ppm. 4000 households were impacted as the chemical seeped into the water supply for at least 4 hours.

&gt;2008 – Germania Springs, Alabama: A fluoride tank at the pumping station emptied its entire contents into the drinking water supply increasing fluoride levels to a reported 20 mg/L. Several residents reported feeling ill.

&gt;2005 – York County, Pennsylvania: 600 gallons of fluoridation chemicals overfed into the public’s drinking water, increasing levels to at least 24ppm for several large municipalities in York and Cumberland Counties.

&gt;2003 – Marlboro, Massachusetts: A mechanical malfunction caused an accidental overfeed of fluoride went undetected for at least two hours into the drinking water, causing a fluoride level of 24 ppm, a significant change to the PH making it more acidic, and causing state environmental officials to warn residents to not use drinking water without flushing their system first.

&gt;2000 – Norfolk and Wakefield, Massachusetts: Error with fluoridation equipment leads to fluoride levels as high as 23 ppm. Local health officials claim no one is affected, however news reports interview at least one resident with diarrhea and dizziness.

&gt;AUGUST 1993 – Poplarville, Mississippi: Fluoride levels at local restaurant reach 48 ppm, perhaps as high as 200 ppm, after accident with town fluoridation equipment. At least 34 of the restaurant’s patrons are poisoned. A study in Public Health Reports finds that “The most common symptoms were nausea (97%), vomiting (68%), diarrhea (65%), and abdominal cramps (53%); 14 people (41%) reported headaches, four (12%) reported burning sensations in the throat or chest, and one person reported excessive salivation. None recalled an abnormal taste to the water.” (SOURCE: Penman 1997)

&gt;MAY 1992 — Hooper Bay, Alaska: One man dies, one man is airlifted to hospital in critical condition and 260 are poisoned. It is the largest reported fluoridation accident to date. Symptoms include “nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, weakness, itching, numbness or tingling of an extremity, shortness of breath (and) fatigue.” (SOURCE: News Tribune 1992 | Gessner 1994)

&gt;FEBRUARY 1992 — Rice Lake, Wisconsin: Residents vomiting. Centers for Disease Control state that 150 water consumers potentially at risk. A pump feed thought to have lasted for two days leads to fluoride levels as high as 20 ppm. The Wisconsin State Dental Director states, “To be harmful, exposure would have to have been about 225 ppm.” This statement is incorrect, as serious adverse symptoms have been reported as low as 50 ppm, and death has occurred at 150 ppm. (SOURCE: Carton 1994)

&gt;JULY 1991 — Portage, Michigan: Approximately 40 children develop abdominal pains, sickness, vomiting and diarrhea at an arts and crafts show at school. One of the city’s fluoride injector pumps failed. Fluoride levels not determined at the time, but later test at 92 ppm. (SOURCE: Carton 1994 | See study discussing this accident)

&gt;OCTOBER 1990 — Westby, Wisconsin: Fluoride levels reach as high as 150 ppm after fluoridation malfunction. Four families suffer a week of diarrhea, upset stomach and burning throats. The water utility supervisor estimates the fluoride level to be ten times normal since it had burned his mouth. The elevated fluoride levels corrode the copper off the pipes in area homes, producing copper concentrations 70 times higher than the EPA recommended limit. (SOURCE: Carton 1994)

&gt;MARCH 1986 – New Haven, Connecticut – Of the 312 persons interviewed four days after the accident, in the 127 households at risk, 18% report symptoms of abdominal cramping, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis (profuse sweating), and fever. Others experience rashes and irritation from bathing and washing dishes. The fluoride levels peak at 51 ppm. ",Fluoridated water is bad for you.

Now this particular one I have actual possible evidence that they might be controlled opposition

Not direct evidence but the behavior seems pretty suspicious


Kristoff let's talk about how there was that major mod shake up when one of them moderators went off the rails and the admins basically handpicked a new set of moderators

After that point a lot of the subreddits rules changed.

Types of host that were basically a part of their culture we're band. Meniere's no more ""number of people who"" posts

They also made a rule that you cannot link directly to anybody's Twitter account except Donald Trump. That seems like a pretty suspicious rule. Before that a lot of pro Trump talking points were shared by linking directly to right-wing pundit Twitter accounts. 


But most recently are other little suspicious things. Like how they have certain words blacklisted to be entire posts or comments removed by the automoderator for certain keywords

and that's normal for every subreddit. But what those keywords are it's pretty suspicious

I mean whether you like her or not Alexandria Cortez is a goldmine for the Republicans. They turned her into a caricature and use her to rile up their base. That's undeniable

and yet her entire name is literally blacklisted from the subreddit. Any post with ""Alexandria Cortez"" or ""AOC"" is immediately removed. Why would they do that? Why would post about one of their most hated politicians not be allowed?


Other banned words include

Sessions (for awhile)

Facebook (for awhile)

AOC

Alexandria Cortez

Andrew yang

Ann Coulter

and I'm sure there's plenty of others that I just haven't even caught yet


they also have blacklisted several right-wing sites that are in some ways pro-trump.

well they had an entire stretch of time that almost all the left-wing websites including NBC MSNBC CNN the New York Times And The Washington Post were de-blacklisted (they had been blacklisted since the campaign)

so there's no direct evidence. The way that the moderators seem to have blacklisted everything that made that sub fun for its users and the way that they carefully curate the front page by using stickies and the way they have blacklisted many words that might be used by Trump supporters makes the entire thing very suspicious

why are they scared to talk about Alexandria Cortez? Why they scared of post mentioning Andrew yang? Neither one of them is even a slight threat to Trump in the 2020 elections. Since one is too young to run and the other has no chance of beating him

What is a blacklist the entire purpose of the sub?

These are questions that there aren't answers to. And I welcomed anybody is input on it. My theory is that a lot of those mods have been bought out. But very special interest groups. I assume some would be right wing special interest groups like The Heritage Foundation or Fox News but others may very well be left wing special interest groups seeking to silence the largest right-wing separated on the internet



L again. You don't have to be right wing or even support that subreddit to be interested in the conspiracy theory. It's a legitimate nonpartisan conspiracy theory can be discussed without involving politics

and it ties into other subreddits on the site are controlled by special interest groups. Such as the movies subreddit possibly being infiltrated by Hollywood companies

381,conspiracy,"The topic of fluoride is making the rounds. We have an issue that is far greater than any potential problems from fluoride. I feel that the topic of fluoride gets far too much attention in comparison to the greater issue of lead and thousands of other contaminants. 

In conversations about fluoride, it is frequently asked:

""Why would the US government want to hinder their own populations intellectual development?""

We already know lead leaches into the water supply due to the significant amount of money it would take to replace all of the lead lines spanning the country's water infrastructure. Lead is a really big problem because officials have been covering up the contamination across the country. Think Flint, but across countless water systems. They are dumbing down a generation on purpose. Think about that.   

To make matters worse, while we have a massive lead water conspiracy, there is also the problem of corporations illegally dumping waste into rivers, and some of these substances are very difficult to detect. The vast majority are not tested for. 

**Lead contamination**:

- ""US authorities distorting tests to downplay lead content of water."" https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/22/water-lead-content-tests-us-authorities-distorting-flint-crisis 

- ""NYC fudged records to show day care centers’ water was tested for lead, but no tests were performed. DOHMH — the agency that's required to inspect all 11,000 child care centers in New York City annually — had more or less given up on the task."" http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-faked-day-care-centers-lead-water-level-test-records-article-1.2686760

- ""5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules."" http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/

- A USA Today investigation has identified ""almost 2,000 additional water systems spanning all 50 states where testing has shown excessive levels of lead contamination over the past four years, and at least 180 of the water systems failed to notify consumers about the high lead levels as federal rules require."" https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/

Why is lead in the water? One reason is because of The Lead Lobby. A lot of the city pipes that carry your water (not just pipes in your house) contain high levels of lead. Many of these are still in use. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509614/

**Information about other contaminants besides lead**:

- ""As of 2010, it was estimated that 84,000 industrial chemicals were used in the United States, with about 700 introduced annually.  Nearly 20 percent are secret, according to the EPA, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision."" http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html

- An extremely tiny percentage of these chemicals are tested for and regulated in tap water. Since we don't know what many of these chemicals are, it's very difficult to test for their presence in tap water. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html 

We obtain our water from lakes or rivers, which go through an insufficient filtering process. If the water in the lake or river is polluted with a chemical that is difficult to remove, then your tap water will also be polluted. Since we only test for about 100 contaminants, we are taking a risk every time we drink from a tap. 

- ""Records analyzed by The New York Times indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves. Companies sometimes test what they are dumping only once a quarter, so the actual number of days when they broke the law is often far higher. And some companies illegally avoid reporting their emissions, say officials, so infractions go unrecorded."" http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/us/13water.html (article written in 2009)

Here's an example of what gets through the filters at water treatment plants: ""94 percent of the tap water in the US is contaminated with plastic fibers."" http://time.com/4928759/plastic-fiber-tap-water-study/

A good example of what happens under these conditions is Dupont's ""C8,"" which caused a variety of medical problems for surrounding populations. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html 

It was also expensive and time-consuming to figure out what Dupont replaced C8 with, and that chemical was also making its way into a nearby river. https://theintercept.com/2016/03/03/how-dupont-concealed-the-dangers-of-the-new-teflon-toxin/



**Radiation contamination in drinking water:**

&gt;Research into Arizona town's uranium-contaminated water supply sparks change

&gt;Town leaders want to know why the state agency issued the first public notice about the danger in August of 2015, despite having reports of chemical samples showing federally unsafe contamination levels more than a decade earlier.

&gt;""Folks have been using the water for so many years without being told,"" said Raymond Smith Jr., a community leader in Sanders. ""Everybody is wondering, why are we just now getting this information?""

http://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/research-into-arizona-towns-uranium-contaminated-water-supply-sparks-change/124812713

Kathleen Hartnett White, the former chair of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality:

&gt;The Senate committee honed in on a 2004 document that showed White openly supported a TCEQ policy of subtracting the margin of error from tests for radiation contamination in water. If a public water supply was found to have amounts of naturally occurring radium or uranium that exceeded federal limits, Texas regulators would subtract the margin of error and lower the results. Under White’s leadership, the agency presented testimony that said, “Maintaining this calculation procedure will eliminate approximately 35 violations.”

&gt;A violation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum limit for radiation would require water systems to notify citizens and take action to clean up the contamination or provide an alternate source of drinking water. White and other leaders in Texas worried about the high costs that might be incurred by water systems for a violation.

**Chemical combinations**:

By now you are realizing that many different contaminants can be in your water, either in low or high amounts, without anyone informing you about it. 

Some chemical combinations can have multiplicative effects (""synergistic toxicity""), which means the toxicity of the combination is much more severe than we would have thought by 'adding' the effects together. We really don't know much about this. Here is one example:

&gt;They show that some oestrogens such as ethinyloestradiol (one of the active ingredients of contraceptive pills) and organochlorine pesticides such as trans-nonachlor, although very weakly active on their own, have the ability to bind simultaneously to a receptor located in the cell nucleus, and to activate it synergistically.

In an interview of Jazz Jennings on the Meredith show she says that she **““realized she was transgender””** at **two years old**:  ***“[At two]*** *I said that I was a girl...I knew who I was on the inside and made sure I defined it. And I asked* ‘***when is the good fairy gonna take me along and change my body parts’*** *...that was a* ***turning moment*** *when they [my parents] realized I was different and had to help me become the girl I knew I was inside.”* 

At **3 years old** she was **diagnosed with gender dysphoria**. 

&gt;*""When I was 2 years old, I went up to my mom and asked her, 'When is the good fairy going to come with her magic wand and change my penis into a vagina?'"" Jazz Jennings, 18, told ABC News' ""Nightline"" co-anchor Juju Chang.*

On her show, “I am Jazz” there is clear *sexualizing of a minor* whether directly (asking her thoughts on an orgasm as a trans girl) or indirectly. They love to dance around the fact that she “has a penis” and talk about her sexuality often. 

Just for starters.

Now that said, there’s more to consider about Jazz: look up the anatomical differences between males and females. Now take a close look at Jazz. ***She has all the markers of a biological female***: feminine skull—no prominent brow ridge, no sloping back forehead, rounded jawline, small chin, no Adam’s apple, soft features, feminine wrists, clearly feminine digit ratio (pointer longer than ring) even how she puts on weight and it looks like hips about as wide as shoulders. And in this [**photo**](http://celebliveupdate.com/jazz-jennings-surgery-transgender-teen-dating-boyfriend/), female proportion arms and shoulders (last picture: *man* on the left, ***woman on the right***)

[other interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4kbybo60Y)

&gt;Notice her **physician** says “Jazz is ***100% girl***.”

[C Riga Shira](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=39s&amp;v=UcbBGvRe4l4) exposes hidden transgenderism in entertainment fashion and politics...if this is the case, then transgender fraud becomes more likely.

Many people—even those who look at conspiracy theories—are quick to label it as “paranoia” or even prejudice (assuming the intent is to slander rather than point out things which concern the public’s interest). But influential people in the spotlight, especially ones who are idolized by children, are very different than people in the general public (because of their influence) and should be held to a different standard.  I believe we have an *obligation* to question the people and the messages which are shifting our perspectives and re-shaping our society as a whole.

**TLDR; Jazz Jennings’ story doesn’t add up.....her show “I am Jazz” has significant sexual discussion/focus (i.e. orgasm talk) despite her being a *minor* at the time......and she appears to have natural female anatomy (skeleton), indicating she may not be transgender. These things should at least be considered since she is praised as a role model for kids with gender dysphoria.**",Jazz Jennings is a FRUAD

The article isn't the best probably, but it's one take on the story, that's for sure. The question is, are these merely the ravings of a delusional former child star, or do they have some actual basis in reality? She accused her father of abusing her, and telling ""them"" to put a microchip in her brain. Microchip or not, her parents have basically had custody/conservatorship of her and she has been in and out of mental institutions ever since, to this day. Her parents control all her money and life decisions even though she is 32 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

The sinister though I keep coming back to is: what if she actually was trying to make a valid point in crying for help about being abused physically and mentally by her father? What if he's too well-connected in the vastly powerful entertainment industry, and he just buried the truth and had her institutionalized and pumped full of drugs? I know people in this sub talk about the pizzagate stuff all the time. We know that the entertainment and business industries are hiding a dark secret of child abuse, trafficking, and potentially mind control, and Amanda Bynes was among the top of the top of child stars. We have documented proof that MKULTRA and its byproducts have been used on civilians, and these programs and all records of them ceased to ""exist"" when Congress tried to look into the matter decades ago. Look at the former Mickey Mouse club stars and how many of them have publicly broken down (far beyond the point of a normal stressful life breakdown). Is this their mental programming beginning to show signs of wear? Look at how many female stars now must pay homage to Marilyn Monroe (allegedly the first celebrity example of a mind-controlled subject) in order to achieve fame and success. Look at how the sexualization of children is becoming normalized in mass media. Look at the mind control imagery present in popular culture, including monarch butterflies, mirrors, black and white checkered floors, etc. It is all interconnected. For a while I thought I was maybe reaching too far or exaggerating, but the more I look into these things, the more it all seems to add up, in an extremely disturbing way. These things are intended to be easily missed, but to those who are aware and ""in the know"", it is something of a sick inside joke. Plausible deniability, coupled with cointel techniques to make anyone asking questions out to seem crazy, ensure that those responsible are never held accountable. It really is insidious and the everyday citizen has absolutely no idea. I hope I'm making all this up, but I know inside that I'm not.

When the internet was created, it was believes that this was an amazing accomplishment of humanity.  It was a bastion of freedom of information and anonymity.  Only to find out 20 years later that it may be quite the opposite.  The internet is now a land of filter bubbles, censorship and the complete loss of all personal privacy.  It is now becoming even creeper with China Social Credit Score type pan-opticon type systems being rolled out.    We really missed the mark in our initial assumptions.

Now it is not far fetched to relate this to crypto.  Touted in much the same manner, it even had a .com crash at year 10 which is similar in timing and execution.  I am beginning to believe that this will be the global currency of the future and will likely be the exact opposite of everything originally thought.  The ruling class has an uncanny ability to corrupt everything and is not sitting idly by while us common folks create a currency that makes them obsolete.  This line of thinking is naive and ignorant of history, even such recent history as the internet itself.

The Mossad infiltration team comprised six Israelis, comprising two cells of three agents, who all received special training at a Mossad base in the Negev Desert in their future control and handling of the “Al Qaeda” cells. One Mossad cell traveled to Amsterdam where they submitted to the operational control of the Mossad’s Europe Station, which operates from the El Al complex at Schiphol International Airport. The three-man Mossad unit then traveled to Hamburg where it made contact with Mohammed Atta, who believed they were sent by Osama Bin Laden. In fact, they were sent by Ephraim Halevy, the chief of Mossad.

The second three-man Mossad team flew to New York and then to southern Florida where they began to direct the “Al Qaeda” cells operating from Hollywood, Miami, Vero Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach. Israeli “art students,” already under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for casing the offices and homes of federal law enforcement officers, had been living among and conducting surveillance of the activities, including flight school training, of the future Arab “hijacker” cells, particularly in Hollywood and Vero Beach.

In August 2001, the first Mossad team flew with Atta and other Hamburg “Al Qaeda” members to Boston. Logan International Airport’s security was contracted to Huntleigh USA, a firm owned by an Israeli airport security firm closely connected to Mossad â€” International Consultants on Targeted Security â€“ ICTS. ICTS’s owners were politically connected to the Likud Party, particularly the Netanyahu faction and then-Jerusalem mayor and future Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

It was Olmert who personally interceded with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have released from prison five Urban Moving Systems employees, identified by the CIA and FBI agents as Mossad agents. (VT and Madsen’s own sources now say that Giuliani and US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald had other teams released as well including those who, according to the 2003 suppressed DOE 9/11 report, placed explosives under the 3 towers and tried to destroy all transportation connectors to Manhattan as well.)

The Israelis were the only suspects arrested anywhere in the United States on 9/11 who were thought to have been involved in the 9/11 attacks. [Source](https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/03/10/blockbuster-wikileaks-suppressed-mossad-ran-911-arab-hijacker-terrorist-operation/)

Here are 3 rules for your corporate/cult/society/religion/institution entity that seeks world domination.

Rule 1. Give people what they want. 
Some boring philosopher once said "" The mob rules Rome. Emperors only appease they're appetite and direct it "". 

People want messiahs, gives them messiahs.
People want to see Alex Jones meltdown at some hippie, go for it.
Keeping people happy is what bread and circuses are all about.
You can secure a low level of political conditioning within the population if you give them what they want. Cheap.
Everyone loves a JFK like figure. Sure you can do that.
Sell they're likeness, merchandise the shit outta them while promoting they're serious political strides.
The everyday Joe saying "" I like this person. They tell me what i want to hear "".
Got them by the balls now.
You don't need to come up with ideas for distracting the population, they will do it for you.
You can fling they're own shit back at them and they'll buy it.

Rule 2. People are attracted to meaning and purpose. Provide it for them.

As cynical as the population likes to believe itself they're not. They're human brains are wired to find meaning even if its not there.
Ever seen one of them on drugs ? secrets of the universe unfolding from a bathroom tile they've been drooling at for half an hour.
You can give them that meaning and purpose. At the same time you can mould they're minds to your preferred philosophy.
Want people to spend more money and work for less. Tell them they're civilisation/country thrives as a race and the winners lives only have value.
Promote the lives of the elite humans who surround themselves in excess. 
This solidifies the philosophy that only the rich lead happy lives in the minds of the working classes.
You can condition the population with meaning. Patriotism is a prime example. So are sports.
If you use rule 1 in conjunction with this, the people will tell you what they want meaning and purpose from. Then you can exploit that.

Rule 3. People love stories and will take morals from them.

Whether its just the boredom of being an average human or they're tiny capacity for intelligence, they love stories.
Anything to pull them away from the deafening monotony of their insignificant lives.
A popular narrative in the consciousness of the population can be exploited.
More automatic rifles for children a bad thing ?. 
Not if Woody and Buzzlight year defend the house from a home invasion and learn a moral lesson about courage and friendship in the process.
Not if the media is saturated with glamorising violence under the guise of moral authority. 
Not if the populations unconscious blood lust is exploited through gladiatorial programming.
"" i don't think its wrong to teach my toddler to use flash bangs. Jesus gives me the right to defend my property. "" the average Joe will say.
People will latch on to a story and rile themselves up. Use humans basic emotion of compassion to fool them into accepting your narrative and morality.
A brave war hero is infact a trained killer but because he was morally justified by popular opinion, the population will pray for them and even idolize them.
Many of the population will have a completely non violent philosophy on life 
and yet still support violence overseas in the name of whatever shit your throwing back at them. ( See Rule 1 )
Stories shape the populations feeble minds. Use they're weaknesses for escapism and condition your morality/philosophy onto them.

I hope this has been helpful and informative for your corporate/cult/society/religion/institution entity that seeks world domination.
Here at Universal Admin we encourage your successful dominance of the earth and will work hard to provide you with the experience 
you need to achieve your goals.

The belief is that in order to get into positions of power you have to transgender your children and yourselves.  There’s a video with lady Gaga getting off a motorcycle and a penis is visible.  With singers it’s because they can become “Castrato’s” which gives them great vocal range for their singing voices (Mariah Carey, Gaga , Madonna).  When a lot of the women get older you can start to see that they are old men because men’s skulls grow more then women’s.  Always look at the width of their shoulders being wider than hips, brow ridge, square jaw, sloping forehead,  40 % larger trachea compared to tea women, long arms, torso straight up and down on possible male-to-female transgenders.

i recently rented an apartment.  pretty cool.  smart one bedroom, but the common areas are epic. more to the point...

the entire building is flying with 5G.

i was going to post a photo of the modem + router set but...

- i kinda forgot 

- i kinda didn't want to specifically single out any particular Brand™ of 5G.

from the moment my partner and i stepped into the building:

- dizziness;

- naucia

- irritable *(what's the noun form of [""irritable""-ness?](https://www.dictionary.com/noresult?term=ir·ri·ta·ble·ness)?)*

- a quick feeling of being *very distracted*

- a constant *hazy mental focus*

i thought it may have been from a couple of factors:

- recently spent of a lot of physical energy moving into a new place;

- probably a bit dehydrated -- ***""stay hydrated""***

- new surrounding / environment / always a bit disconcerting

**i decided to log into my router, and** ***TURN-OFF 5G service*****:**

- i suggest everyone does this... ***(i.e., turn-off your 5G service)***

- 99% of Americans (and probably the same for the world) do not need 5G.  here's why

 - improved range ***-- NOT FUCKING ""SPEED""***

 - if you live in apartment, and you have 5G, you're a fucking idiot.  you might as well buy a fucking Ferrari, and and park that fucking Ferrari in your fucking living room.  yea, a lot of good that does you, right?! :D  ok. well... it's that how fucking stupid it is to have a 5 fucking G router in your apartment.

 - - #1 you are always limited to your internet provider's speed -- which is going to be ***WAY fucking slower*** than **2G**.  

 - - #2  you don't need the range.  mate, 2G got you and your apartment covered by an order of magnitude.

 - - [meta] fuck you shills pro 5G shills -- that's all you are, **go suck a phat dick in your mouth** :O{=fatfuckingstinkydickinshillsmouth


i digress.

fair to say, within minutes of turning-off my 5G services *(my router had both 2G and 5G turned-on, which most routes with 5G do also have an activate 2G service)*, both my wife and i noticed a steady decrease in:

- dizziness;

- naucia

- irritable *(what's the noun form of [""irritable""-ness?](https://www.dictionary.com/noresult?term=ir·ri·ta·ble·ness)?)*

- a quick feeling of being *very distracted*

- a constant *hazy mental focus*

so then i thought... ok... well, it did take me a day to think about and then actually DO ...turning-ff my 5g services.  so it was like at least 48 hours of having been settled.  a couple of nights of ""restful"" sleep - kinda ;)  i definitely was able to hydrate.  ok... so maybe it wasn't the 5G.  maybe i was just feeling better.

so... tonight i come down to the business center (epic 30 foot ceilings).  within minutes of getting situated, all the symptoms (see above) start coming back. and i will also note that every time i step outside i feel fine.  all good.  back to normal.

so (for me), it's pretty much that noticeable.

**5G viscerally fucks with me.**

and again, i personally don't need 5G anyway.  and most people don't -- its like, why?!  do you live on a goddamn ranch? ok fine.. do your do mate, but... for the rest of us, a single, central 2G router is all you need to provide stable network service to a:

- studio;

- a one bedroom;

- up to a 5 bedroom (reasonably)

- a small to medium-sized, single floor house;

- a small, single floor building;

- a small, single floor retail space;

---

sidenote:  i think elon and peter thiel and some of silcon valley elite are fucking out there on some crazy trips.  on the one hand, i love the idea of free internet for the world (i.e., what i believe is elon's mission with the ... micro-5g satellites to provide 5G router service to the globe.    love the concept.  on the other hand 5G makes me viscerally naucious -- which is a bit concerning to me.

I fully fully believed they did 9/11, even years after watching 'Fahrenheit 9/11' and the other documentary that I can't remember the name of.

So for years, I knew 911 was a lie.. But still blamed Muslims and our government. Our goverment knew these crazy religious idiots were gunna hijack planes and kill tons of people and our goverment let them do it. Fuck them and fuck anyone that looks like them. I was conditioned exactly as planned. Hate Muslims for 911 and let the war on terror happen.

That was until a few years ago when I started to question those very same documentaries.. I found it odd that extreme Muslims who are willing to kill themselves for thier religion would be doing coke and banging bookers before hand... That was my first clue.

It made me hate Muslims even more. Now they are crazy hypocrites.. And their holy book tells them to kill anyone thats not a believer. Being an athiest, I saw Islam as the top problem in the world. The thing that needs solving.




But then I watched a documentary called 'Boston Unbombing - How and Why Boston was a staged false flag hoax attack.' This changed everything. I recognized the purpose of the hoax...to justify invading more land. Got me thinking.. The goverment staged Boston event.. Lied about Muslims...hmmm


So i went back research 911. And there it was. The piece of evidence so strong that it survived a plane exploding inside of one of the towers, survived being burnt on the way down, survived the crumbling buildings falling onto themselves, and was discovered by FBI on 911 and turned over to our lovely press as strong evidence that Muslims hijacked the plane. This very strong piece of evidence I refer to as 'The Magic Muslim Passport'

This is the piece of evidence that proves that NO muslims were involved in hijacking any planes.




Here is the logic

'fake events have fake evidence. Real events have real evidence' - if muslims did hijack planed on it 911, there would be no need to present the country fake evidence. They could wait and supply us real evidence. But none exists bc no muslims hijacked planes. None. No planes were hijacked.

 1) reinforces the lie that Muslims did 911 

2)frames a major Arab country with vast oil supplies that Israel would prefer to own 

3) it hurts American tade relations. SA buys our number one export, weapons.

i.e., He's not a Pedo.  He's just a creepy touchy feely guy.

Consider the the Joe Joe the Pedo™ conspiracy is one of the Flat Earth's of politics.  

 - Beau knew too much.  

 - Biden needed to be kept in check.  Isn't that what they do? Right?  They (the deep-state) accuses you doing when ***they*** are actively doing (pedophilia and child trafficking).  This just reeks of a disinfo campaign.

- Julian Assange is Possibly Renditioned;

- Mueller Report just came out w/o any Trump incitements;

- Jussie + Harris + Booker

458,conspiracy,"#Affirmative action policies in medical (medical field generally) school admissions reduces the supply of medical providers, and acts as a protectionist measure to further raise the barrier to entry and reduce competition among providers.  This reduces medical patient options in the care/treatment process, reinforces the power of licensing monopolies, reinforces a small elite of medical providers, decreases competition among medical professionals, decreases the motivation for quality among medical professionals, creates an artificial scarcity of medical professionals, and encourages higher healthcare costs.

------------------------

Note:  discussion on 'more doctors doesn't matter if there's not more beds' is sometimes brought up as an excuse for monopolistic practices effecting the size of the medical workforce and easy access to medical care.  First, there are other factors affecting the artificial scarcity in medicine such as crony 'certificates of need' which serve to limit distribution of medical facilities and equipment. Second, medical providers benefit from making healthcare artificially scarce by getting higher prices and more elitist status.


&gt;The study, being published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found that the incomes of primary care doctors and orthopedic surgeons were substantially higher in the United States than in other countries. Moreover, it said, the difference results mainly from higher fees, not from higher costs of the doctors’ medical practice, a larger number or volume of services or higher medical school tuition.

&gt;The case of health care regulations is an interesting one, as state governments have empowered private medical boards with unilateral authority to set the rules for the medical profession, including the issuing and revoking of medical licenses. These boards effectively function like government regulatory agencies, with the important difference that they lack the opportunity for public comments, and thus are immune from any political pressure from citizens.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Retail clinics, pharmacies, and even supermarkets are capable of offering routine medical services to patients with a convenience and regularity impossible in traditional physicians’ offices. Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) has aggressively lobbied against the availability of this type of facility.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;There are currently only 129 accredited medical schools in the United States, too few to turn out enough doctors to meet the demand.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;By reducing the regulatory burden on physicians, providing more competition among medical boards, and permitting more autonomy for alternative practitioners, patients could see both relief from the coming doctor shortage, as well as lower prices across the board for medical care.

&gt;To some extent, dentistry created its own problem. Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Health Association, said today's shortage of dentists can be traced to the closing of seven dental schools in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1980, he said, the United States produced 6,300 dentists. Ten years later, the number was down to 4,000.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Some groups representing doctors are resisting similar efforts to allow nurse practitioners to, for example, write prescriptions and admit patients to the hospital.

https://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2013/12/30/are_there_enough_doctors_for_the_newly_insured_786.html

&gt;The Association of American Medical Colleges has recently predicted a nationwide shortage of somewhere between 40,800 and 104,900 physicians by 2030.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ironically, one of the biggest obstacles to improving access to health care providers is the profession itself, enabled by a plethora of public and private agencies that control licensing and certification. These often inadvertently limit access to care rather than enhance it.

#Affirmative action supports monopolistic medicine


&gt;""In addressing the question of whether minority physicians are more likely to serve underserved populations, studies have relied on self-report survey data and the definition of an underserved population has varied.""
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;""Researchers examined the failure rates from a national sample of all first-time U.S. medical student examinees from 1986 through 1988 and found that approximately 50% of African-American examinees failed the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Part I competency-based licensure test, compared to a 12% failure rate for whites""
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;""Because medical schools are highly selective, the size of the observed racial group differences will in practice almost eliminate the selection of certain minorities when that selection is based on maximizing the academic achievement and/or intellectual aptitude measures.""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623946/

&gt;""And we should cap the number of Jews if non-Jews prefer not to have Jewish doctors, and the number of doctors of non-Western religions (Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, etc.) if they are less desired by the general population of patients.""

https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/09/17/data-impact-black-doctors-may-raise-implications-affirmative-action

&gt;However, Princeton University's Russ Nieli argues that affirmative action only serves to reinforce negative stereotypes, particularly for black and Latino applicants. Instead, he argues for a completely merit-based system that accounts for specific qualifications that can help meet patient needs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Until that occurs, ""the huge credentials gap between black entrants to medical and professional schools and whites and Asians will remain—and along with it, the understandable suspicion of the competence of the black graduates,""

Meanwhile, the Israeli press is reporting that they all had secret meetings with this council of Jewish overlords.

Which is worse?

Giving a public speech to a foreign body of elite overlords, or meeting with those foreign overlords secretly while pretending to the goyim that you are not beholden to that cryptocracy?

In actual fact, the entire concept of AIPAC having this conference is outdated.

The reality of Jewish rule is that it only works when people are told they are not being ruled by Jews. So having all of these politicians go to a conference and publicly pledge allegiance to a foreign power really was not fit for this model of government-by-conspiracy.

It was possible in a pre-internet era to have these conferences and not have anyone see the video.

But now that we can see the video – wow.
https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/after-boycott-claims-four-democratic-presidential-hopefuls-meet-aipac-delegates-1.7063905

Chuck Schumer declared that he was “The Guardian of Israel” at an AIPAC conference.

At an AIPAC-adjacent Jewish Occupation Government conference, Nancy Pelosi declared that if the American Capitol crumbled, we would still send billions of dollars to Israel.

I think the Jews realized this is a problem when Ilhan Omar went out there and said “AIPAC!” and they had to call her an anti-Semite spreading anti-Semitic canards for simply mentioning that the organization exists.

People were like “well, if this is a hateful canard, then what the fuck are these videos of politicians swearing allegiance to Israel about???”

They were really pushing the limits of reality itself by trying to claim that it is an act of hatred to simply say that this organization exists and that American politicians go there and pledge to serve this foreign country. In fact, I have never seen anything like it.

Jewish rule is predicated on the fact that people do not know they are being ruled by Jews. There is nothing that actually even compares to this in history. Historically, there was always a king who you knew was in charge and if you knew that the buck stopped with him. If you had a grievance about something that was happening in the country, the responsibility of addressing it ultimately fell on the king.

“Democracy” really is a Jewish invention. Because in this system, no one can ever be held responsible for anything. People have a need to point at some individual or group of individuals responsible for things that are happening, and in democracy, no one really knows where to point. Everyone that you try to point at can always point at someone else.

And then in the background of all of it, there are these Jews moving through the shadows and manipulating all events.

This is why “democracy” has become the highest moral value in a system run by Jews and it is why they attempt to spread it throughout the world using war.



Jews know that because the head of state in a democracy is merely a figurehead for a massive bureaucracy, and can be voted in and out whenever the people tire of them while the bureaucracy remains entrenched, that all they have to do to control a democracy is maintain control over the money and the media.

When we talk about “democracy,” we are simply talking about “rule by a hidden group of Jews.”



No one is allowed to say “Jews control everything” because Jews do control everything. If they didn’t control everything, then they could easily just laugh it off. Instead, they come down on you like they’ve come down on me and everyone else who has gone out there and said this in recent years. You get kicked off the internet, banned from everything, they sue you, they try to arrest you on trumped up fake charges.

Imagine if someone went out there and said that the Japanese or Samoans secretly control America. No one would care. Alex Jones says that Chinese control America, and no one cares about that.

Instead, he gets attacked for talking about black crime, supporting the First and Second Amendment, etc. They even call him an anti-Semite, despite how hard he tries to avoid that, because he talks about “globalists” and “international bankers.” I have never seen a mainstream news article that attacked Jones for saying Chinese people control America, and I have never seen an article about me that didn’t attack me for saying Jews control America.

The reason you can’t say “Jews control America” is because it’s true, and if you say it, you find out just how true it is when the entire world comes down on your neck.

For almost three years since 9/11 independent researchers have stockpiled individual smoking guns which prove that the official version of events was not only a lie but operationally impossible.

However, no single smoking gun has yet been forwarded to explain why air defenses categorically reversed Standard Operating Procedure and failed to respond to hijacked jetliners.

Until now. More and more individuals are looking at the facts and highlighting exercise drills that took place on the morning of 9/11.

It is clear that at least five if not six training exercises were in operation in the days leading up to and on the morning of 9/11. This meant that NORAD radar screens showed as many as 22 hijacked airliners at the same time. NORAD had been briefed that this was part of the exercise drill and therefore normal reactive procedure was forestalled and delayed.

The large numbers of 'blips' on NORAD screens that displayed both real and 'drill' hijacked planes explain why confused press reports emerged hours after the attack stating that up to eight planes had been hijacked. [Click here](http://www.rense.com/general13/up.htm) for that article.

The drill scenario also explains a comment made by air traffic control personnel which was featured in a July 2004 BBC television report. [Click here](http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/july2004/220704flightcontroller.htm) for that video clip and article. The controller is told that a hijacked airliner is heading for New York and responds by saying, ""is this real world or an exercise?""

Alex Jones was one of the first to highlight the wargames in his documentary film 'Masters of Terror', which was released in August 2002. [Click here](http://www.prisonplanet.tv/video/masters_clip.WMV) to watch a video clip. Alex explains why the [Associated Press](http://www.prisonplanet.com/agency_planned_exercise_on_sept_11_built_around_a_plane_crashing_into_a_building.htm) later had to admit the fact that the CIA were running drills of crashing planes into buildings on the morning of 9/11.

**What were the drills called and what was their nature?**

&gt;1) OPERATION NORTHERN VIGILANCE: This was planned months in advance of 9/11 and ensured that on the morning of 9/11, jet fighters were removed from patrolling the US east coast and sent to Alaska and Canada, therefore reducing the amount of fighter planes available to protect the east coast.  
2) BIOWARFARE EXERCISE TRIPOD II: Alex Jones first reported on this back in May when Rudolph Giuliani let the details of it slip in his testimony to the 9/11 Commission. FEMA arrived in New York on September 10th to set up a command post located at Pier 29 under the auspices of a 'biowarfare exercise scheduled for September 12. This explains why Tom Kenney of FEMA's National Urban Search and Rescue Team, [told Dan Rather of CBS News](http://www.prisonplanet.com/fema_clip.mp3) that FEMA had arrived in New York on the night of September 10th. This was originally dismissed as a slip of the tongue. Giuliani was to use this post as a command post on 9/11 after he evacuated WTC Building 7. As we [reported back in January](http://www.prisonplanet.com/011904wtc7.html), Giuliani knew when to leave WTC 7 because he got advanced warning that the Trade Towers were about to collapse. ""We were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was gonna collapse,"" Rudolph Giuliani told Peter Jennings of ABC News. How did Giuliani know the towers were about to collapse when no steel building in history had previously collapsed from fire damage?  
📷3) OPERATION VIGILANT GUARDIAN: This exercise simulated hijacked planes in the north eastern sector and started to coincide with 9/11. Lt. Col. Dawne Deskins, NORAD unit's airborne control and warning officer, was overseeing the exercise. At 8:40am she took a call from Boston Center which said it had a hijacked airliner. Her first words, as quoted by Newhouse News Service were, ""It must be part of the exercise."" This is another example of how the numerous drills on the morning of 9/11 deliberately distracted NORAD so that the real hijacked planes couldn't be intercepted in time.  
4) OPERATION NORTHERN GUARDIAN: The details of this exercise are still scant but it is considered to be part of Vigilant Guardian, relating to simulating hijacked planes in the north eastern sector.  
5) OPERATION VIGILANT WARRIOR: This was referenced in Richard Clarke's book 'Against All Enemies'. It is thought to have been the 'attack' component of the Vigilant Guardian exercise.

Another example of how air defenses were purposefully kept preoccupied so they couldn't protect New York was [reported by this website](http://www.propagandamatrix.com/051203atlanticcityfighters.html) in December of 2003. The Air National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing, based at Atlantic City International Airport in Pomona, were just eight minutes away from New York and could have intercepted both Flight 11 and Flight 175.

Under NORAD procedures that date to the Cold War, two F-16 fighters from the 177th were parked around the clock on the Atlantic City runway. Pilots waited in a nearby building, ready to scramble.

But on the morning of 9/11, the F-16's were performing bombing runs over an empty stretch of the Pine Barrens near Atlantic City after being decommissioned from their usual role of protecting the skies of the east coast.

It was only after both trade towers were hit that the two F-16s landed and were refitted with air-to-air missiles, then sent aloft.

Now that we have established how NORAD were confused, delayed and distracted by the numerous wargames, the next question to ask is who if anyone was aware of which planes were 'real world' and which planes were 'exercise'? The answer to this question will provide us with the name of the individual who ran the operational execution of the 9/11 attack.

 Evil Is Invisible, part 3

A talk by Vernon Howard given on 12-21-85 

&amp;#x200B;

""Story time following the themes that we have covered. There was once a big country, and this country had a national ball game. Just like we have football and baseball and other sports. National ball game. Everybody played it from the children in the lots next door to the school grounds to the big national teams that engage in this ball game. Everybody played it. Real exciting. Everybody watched it on television on Sunday afternoon. 

There was a scientist, a medical scientist who studied human injuries like in traffic accidents and in factories. And he made a study of this national ball game which was enormously popular. And he noticed something that had never been noticed before. And he attended the ball games and he made notes and put them into his computer and he got on his typewriter. And he wrote out some papers on this ball game. And presented them to the public. And here is what these discoveries were all about. He made it clear that though no one noticed it, the injuries, severe injuries, to the athletes playing this game were far more numerous than anyone knew.

 After a game and a certain team won, it wasn't mentioned that three players had to be carried off on stretchers, paralyzed and seriously hurt by the violence of the game. That was a pretty rough game. No one heard about the serious injuries, but his report stated it. And he sent it to newspapers, anyone who would listen. Was a guest on television shows, and he pointed out what a violent game this was, an awful lot of people were getting hurt out there in the field. That was just the beginning, because he had a good mind. He could look and analyze and dissect things clearly.

He also pointed out that because this game was so violent and people took sides with their team against the other team that there were both major disturbances among the spectators and major riots – minor disturbances and major riots. Some of the riots, a lot of people were killed. They'd go crazy when the referee called a decision they didn't like against their team, they rioted. They threw bottles and threw pop cans. They hit each other and even crossed the field. You know, one team audience on one side and the other fans on the other side, they would cross the field and start fighting with each other.

 But the media didn't play that up at all. They kept it very quiet. But the report – no question about it. There was something very much wrong with what was going on. Hundreds of times a week all over the nation people were just getting hurt, and some of them never came back to a game after they got in one of these riots, and the players didn't come back to play again the next game because they were out of commission all together. Put his paper out.

 Well, he was a good scientist, but he didn't know human nature. So he was surprised when nobody paid attention. Here he was – wouldn't you like to know if members of your family getting hurt in doing something. You would want to know. He put the information out and nobody seemed to care. It was ignored. He couldn't believe it. 

I mean it was just like, you know, in wartime you would say war is bad, right? War kills soldiers and hurts civilians too. He was stunned by the lack of reaction to his astounding exposé of the violence and the injuries over what had been a very popular national game. No one had ever brought it out before. There it is and nobody paid any attention. He couldn't believe it. So he, ""Oh well,"" he said, ""I haven't told enough newspapers. I haven't been interviewed on radio and television enough. I will redouble my efforts. Run a few ads too."" And he did. No response. 

No outcries of indignation over we've got to change the rules on this game to make it a right game. And he even offered the rules. Ten rules on how to make this an enjoyable game. You are given ten rules, a thousand rules on how to change from a violent life to a healthy, peaceful and fun filled life. Aren't you? Again no response. As a matter of fact the very opposite of what he expected to happen happened to him. One day after working hard telling everybody this awfulness that was going on. The pain – you know what it is to get physically hurt. A thousand times worse than people ever imagined. Nobody paid attention.

 One day he went home. And he took out mail out of the mailbox, and he looked at one letter. It didn't have a return address on it. He looked it up and opened it, and it was a threat against his life. This letter said, ""If you don't stop publishing your exposure of our beloved national game, you are going to get it."" He knew what they meant. They're going to go after him. 

And that was just the start. Instead of appreciation and praise for his discoveries that would have lead to more help for more people, instead of that he was threatened. Hate letters. They increased in volume. He noticed that the reporters didn't want to interview him anymore. They saw his persistence and they did not want that. He wouldn't be written up in the papers. They didn't want him on radio and television anymore. And he didn't understand it. You understand it. Don't you? You know what I am talking about. 

So here he was trying to do a good thing, and the opposite happened. Now he was being viciously attacked and the lies – you wouldn't believe the lies they told about him. ""What are you getting out of this? You are just a show-off. You want to see your name in the papers."" Every possible kind of lie, falsehood and slander and viciousness. 

He went from understanding scientific principles about the national ball game to understanding something about human nature. Began to get a little suspicious that people weren't at all what he thought they were. You know why he thought that, don't you? Because he thought he was a nice man. And what a shock he had to go through to see that he did have a lot of egotism in himself that he hadn't uncovered. Now he is beginning to understand the other evil by first understanding self evil. Which was a shock but he knew it was a healthy one. He was a good student of the lessons that everyday life had to give to him.  

He said, ""All right. I have investigated the ball game and came out with some astonishing and shocking facts. Now I am going to investigate why nobody wants to be saved from being hurt, from the riots, and all the heartache that comes from human beings hurting each other both on the field and in the stand. ""I am going to find out what is going on. I don't know what is going on, but I am going to find out."" 

You know what he found out? What we have been talking about up to this point. About evil being invisible. Something you don't see. There is an evil headquarters. You can call it Hell if you want. An evil headquarters that is sending up its messages and instructing its evil spirits to inhabit human beings to try to prevent them from getting healthy. He began to understand this, so he did some investigation. You know what he found out? Here is what he found out. He discovered what was really in back of not only just the resistance, but the violent hatred and attack on him for exposing the ball game as it was now played. He found out that there were manufacturers of ball game equipment, uniforms, the balls themselves, all the equipment necessary for the game. He found out that those manufacturers of the game were behind it. They didn't want to change the rules. They didn't want the game to become safer. If it became safer, then they would lose money in one way or another. 

He found out that the operators of the stadium, that nice smiling man who appeared and who welcomed the hundred thousand top the ball game smiling with a flower in his lapel, and he was one of the city officials. That man had an interest in the commercialization of the stadium itself and all the concessions, the popcorn and the peanuts and all that. There is a lot of money in that. 

One hundred thousand people in one stadium several times a month, and that is duplicated all over. There is a lot of money in that. The operators of the stadium, of the equipment, the parking lots, the cafes surrounding the stadium. Before and after people go and they have their drinks and they have their dinners. Nobody wanted the situation changed because they would lose out financially. But do you think they are going to come right out and say that in public? Of course not.

 In order to continue to make a profit from the game as it is now played, in order to get money, and power and position, what do they care if thousands of human beings are wounded in the mob violence. What do they care if the players are hauled off and never come back? What do they care? They have what they wanted. Invisible evil works like that. 

Now your exercise, your work is to take today's talk from the start and work up to this example I gave you and you are to look and see how true it is in all human affairs. What if there are ways to abolish crime? How many people would be put out of work? What would all the policemen and the wardens and the judges and the lawyers do for a living if crime was abolished? Crime is a national pastime. It is a sport. You abolish it, then what is going to happen to the income of all of these people? It is going to vanish.  

Are you understanding it? I know you are. Are you ever going to look at any human being again and think that he or she is what he or she pretends he or she is? You are never going to do it again. And the reason that you are never going to do it again is because you have followed the spiritual law ""Look at yourself first."" If you don't do that, you will remain one of the greedy, vicious owners of the stadium or the manufacturers of the equipment or the owners of the bars, and you will want your reward whether it is financial or popularity, approval, whatever it might be. You will want your reward from this world. Which means that you won't have a reward from the other world. 

I know you don't understand what that means yet to have a spiritual reward, something that is higher than what you are getting now. But you will understand it if you perform the exercise until you shockingly come face to face with your petty greed. With your wish to get a nickel.

 See, you see it is not the nickel that counts, it is the ""I won"" that counts, and it is not even the ""I won,"" but the feeling that ""I exist"" that counts. 

None of those greedy merchants are ever going to track their own sickness, neurosis back to that point. They are never going to do it. They are not going to wake up. You are here to wake up, not to continue to be one of the greedy merchants. Your exercise is clear to you. Track it way back. Until you understand quite clearly that evil is invisible and its purpose is to prevent other human beings from waking up. And they don't go around saying that to themselves, because evil is unconscious of itself. It's built in to it. Work on the exercise and take a break.""","Evil is Invisible, part 3, final part"

A law is something you can be sentenced for, so that doesnt make sense. You cant be sentenced for breaking that law. You can only be sentenced (in theory if cops believed in giving tickets for it) for a ban on jaywalking. It should take 90% agreement to ban jaywalking and 30% to allow it.

499,conspiracy,"Jussie Smollett's 16 charges were dropped, as it was determined that he was telling the truth about his attack.

This is a blatant demonstration of the inevitable flaws in our current justice system. Any reasonable person can see that his actions are not consistent with somebody who has endured this psychological trauma- not only the strange attack but also the shame he underwent for America calling him a liar.

Let's assume, for the sake of this discussion, that Jussie Smollett has been telling the truth all along.

Jussie Smollett is an innocent, black, gay actor doing well in a critically-acclaimed television show. One day, he receives a letter at work- something that looks like a ransom note a six year old made, saying ""You will die black f\*g"" with a drawing of a gun shooting a hanging person.

That's fucking rude. But he soldiers on, as the hero he is. One week later, at around 2am near his apartment, two masked men pour bleach on him, wrap a noose around his neck, tells him ""This MAGA country, n\*\*\*a,"" and punch him.

Jussie appears on television and tells his story. He is [reluctant to report the incident to police](https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-alleged-jussie-smollett-attack/story?id=61124090), and when they arrived at his home to interview him, he was still wearing the rope. Remember, he is telling the truth, so we'll assume he's in a deep state of self-deprecating despair. He is partying in his palace of pity- okay, fair enough.

Seventeen days after the attack, the news is telling everyone that the attackers claim they were paid. They are implying Jussie is a liar. It appears this story makes sense to America and they begin gratuitously shaming him. Imagine being our hero on this day, how angry it must have made him to hear this atrocious, abhorrent nonsense!

But the police are convinced he's lying. Jussie gets arrested for filing false police reports! What is this shit- I'm the victim here!!

Instead of addressing the lies, and clearing his name of all of the slander- Jussie hides and hires one of the most prestigious lawyers in the world. He doesn't assert his truth and pay a regular rich lawyer to defend him. He hides and hires Mark Geragos- known for taking the legal wheel when an obviously guilty rich person is in deep shit. He defended Chris Brown for beating Rihanna, Colin Kaepernick for protesting NFL, William Lych- a priest accused of molestation, Michael Jackson for alleged molestation, Winona Ryder for shoplifting, with many more big names.

So we are Jussie Smollett in court hearing that our sixteen charges have been dropped. Finally, they believe me! SHIT! I'm relieved, but mostly I'm fucking pissed. My reputation has been crucified and these lawyer fees have been kicking my ass. I can't wait to get the counter-lawsuits going! They fucked me and it's time to take what's mine!!

But no- he doesn't seem to feel angry at all. He continues to hide. The police are looking to collect north of $100,000 from Jussie to cover the investigation costs. Shouldn't Jussie be looking to collect north of $5M to cover his tarnished reputation based on their lies?

**His actions are not consistent with somebody who has been telling the truth since day one.**

The media will use this news as an opportunity to condemn conspiracy theorists. They will say things like, ""look, we thought there was a conspiracy and we were wrong. Conspiracies are fake and people who believe in them are wrong.""

509,conspiracy,"I have recently observed how youtube is slowly but steadily starting to censor channels. this is mostly regarding profanity and things like that. Now obviously they don't straight up remove or change videos that are uploaded, but what they do is that when they see a video that has too much swearing they say ""We can't monetize your video until you remove the profanity"". And since they need to get paid they oblige. Most don't really have a choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent example i've seen of this is [Angry Joes video on BFV](https://youtu.be/ywfK3_cW3pU). And to me he seems kinda exhausted by the whole concept of having to censor his videos because he can't swear. But guess what anger and swearing is a part of his image and partially what made him famous. I don't like that this censoring is forcing creators to change their image and identity. 

&amp;#x200B;

One other example i've seen of this is when Pewdiepie said in a video that since he stopped swearing and talking about edgy and controversial subjects his problem with YT and monetization has faded away. Now on one hand that's great for him that he get's his videos monetized, but on the other hand also he is slightly changing his image to fit what youtube wants him to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the reason i'm only mildly worried is that this is as I perceive it only the very small and seemingly insignificant start. But that's the point, start with the smallest of altercations and as such the subjects of the censoring wont even notice. Gradually build up more and more restrictions and censoring and nobody at all will notice. And i mean it's kinda brilliant in the sense that they have the creators gladly accepting the censorship because they are already so damn tired of having their income terminated. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is how it has always been done throughout history. Successful censorship builds up overtime and as i mentioned earlier no one will notice and perhaps they will even embrace it with open arms.",Youtube censoring it's content creators is mildly worrying to me

2. Overly slick production. When someone comes out of nowhere and has an expensive looking setup, they have financial backers and you have no reason to trust the motives of those backers. Many of these will be domestic or foreign military intelligence officers posing as independent journalists.

3. Immediately after some important accusation or claim is made, the marketplace of ideas is flooded with many outrageous ideas. The intention is to divert attention and to distract from the real to to the false. For example: story breaks about John X engaging in a sex crime. Next day many other things hit the news that can take the spotlight off his unfortunate situation.

As a result we’re still able to enjoy his art today in the form of television, music and movies.

I want to take you down the road of a conspiracy theory. It will absolutely be brushed off by over half of you, but regardless I’m going to guide you down the rabbit-hole.

It was a bad coincidence that he was scheduled to be on that flight. When the Elite Powers That Be saw his name on the flight list, they intercepted communication between Seth and his travel agent. They ensured that he was given the wrong time so he would not be killed.

His show Family Guy had already been on the air for two years, and young Seth MacFarlane was a valuable asset to the Elite. Anyone and everyone who was communicating to the masses must be in their control. If they are able to control the entertainment we consume, they can keep our minds in check, and ensure their agenda is being followed.

Here are strange coincidences of his shows, which take 9-12 months to produce, eerily depicting real life events:

**#1: New Zealand Shooting - Family Guy**

On 3/24/19, ""You Can't Handle the Booth"", we see CHRIST terrorizing CHURCH-goers. The exterior shot shows the church burned down and we can see the [name of the church](http://oi66.tinypic.com/154jztf.jpg): ""Holy CHRIST CHURCH."" Later in the episode, we see Peter, one white man, among a large group of Muslims [looking nervous](http://oi63.tinypic.com/24l24j9.jpg). The shooting happened on 3/15/19. Family Guy did not air a new episode on its regularly scheduled slot on 3/17/19, despite Bob's Burgers and Simpsons both airing a new episode on that day. It's likely Fox delayed the episode because of these images; this would not be the first time they've pulled MacFarlane's shows [following a massacre.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/family-guy-american-dad-pulled-by-fox-sandy-hook-school-shooting_n_2306911)

**#2: New Zealand Shooting - American Dad** 

3/25/19, Funnyish Games - an episode all about home security, appearing to metaphorize national security. It opens with Francine reading her phone and laughing hysterically at the news of their middle-eastern neighbors being robbed and brutally pistol-whipped. Later, Stan orchestrates a fake home invasion to convince Francine they need better home security (orchestrating false flags to convince population they need better national security.) Francine: ""I can't sleep since the home-invasion!"" Stan: ""Ah, you mean the eye-opening demonstration?"" Later in the episode, we see Stan's home [shooting at a Muslim](http://oi64.tinypic.com/330d54l.jpg) in the name of home security.

**#3: Boston Marathon - Family Guy**

On 03/17/13, the episode Turban Cowboy aired featuring Peter meeting a terrorist and subsequently becoming one. In one scene, Peter presses a button on a phone that his new friend gave him and an explosion, followed by screams are heard. Peter presses another button, and we hear a second explosion, followed by more screams.

Later in the episode, we see an eerie joke about Peter driving his car through marathon runners, leaving a trail of blood and dead bodies. It cuts to Peter describing how he won the Boston Marathon to a TV interviewer, revealing that he was committing mass murder at the Boston Marathon.

A month later, on 04/15/13, the Boston Marathon Bombing occurred, which included two blasts.

**#4: Boston Marathon - American Dad**

Two days before the bombing, on 4/13/13, American Dad released an episode with the following dialogue:

Hailey: I gotta be honest with you Snot, I wasn't really looking forward to this night, but I had a blast.

Snot: Well, call the bomb squad! Cuz with the blast I had, that makes TWO blasts!! (visually shows 2 fingers) \*creepy laugh\*

**#5: Robin Williams suicide - Family Guy**

On 05/20/12, an episode aired featuring Peter as a King Midas-like character, except everything he touches turns to Robin Williams. The fiasco becomes too much for Peter to handle, and he tries repeatedly to commit suicide, each attempt being stopped by Robin Williams. In one visual, we see Peter putting a gun to his head, but the gun turns into a Robin Williams.

On 08/11/14, while news was being reported that Robin Williams had committed suicide, the BBC3 network happened to be playing this episode.

**#6: Virginia Tech Shooting - American Dad**

The episode ""Vacation Goo"" was originally set to air on 04/29/07. There was a scene where Stan was wearing a ""V TECH"" shirt and was shouting ""Hokies!"" at the screen to root on Virginia Tech's football team.

The shooting happened on 04/16/07, so the scene was reanimated and the whole episode was pushed back so fans wouldn't think they were making fun of the tragedy.

**#7: Bruce Jenner’s transition - Family Guy**

In an episode from 2009, after Stewie is told that Bruce Jenner is a man, he replies with ""No, Brian. That’s what the press would have you believe, but he’s not. Bruce Jenner is a woman. An elegant, beautiful Dutch woman.""In another episode from 2011, Jenner is seen flamboyantly dancing in front of Navy men who are cheering him on as if he is a sexy woman.

In 2015, we of course got the news about Caitlyn Jenner.

**#8: Kevin Spacey allegations - Family Guy**

In 2005 an episode was aired where Stewie runs through a mall screaming that he needs help because he has escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement. The allegations came out in 2017.

**#9: Death of Paul Walker - Family Guy**

On 11/24/13, an episode was aired where Seth spontaneously killed off a very integral character, Brian, when he was hit by a car. On 11/30/13, the character of Brian from Fast of The Furious, Paul Walker, died in a car crash.

**#10: Harvey Weinstein allegations - The 2013 Oscars**

During a monologue before an award in 2013, Seth makes a joke about how the women nominated no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein. The allegations came forth in October 2017.

**#11: Bret Ratner allegations - Family Guy**

In a 2012 episode, we see Stewie dressed as a girl showing off for bidders, apparently for sex trafficking. Brett Ratner bids $75k on Stewie. In November of 2017, six women came forward accusing him of sexual assault.

**#12: Death of George H.W. Bush - Family Guy**

George Herbert Walker Bush died on 11/30/18. Two days later on 12/2/18, The long running character of Herbert, who uses a walker, is killed off. Despite it seeming like the end of Herbert, he popped up on a 3/24/19 episode, making the death episode stranger.

I agree that some of these are most likely mere coincidences but I theorize that some of these things were either Seth himself warning us, or the Elite specifically telling him to include a certain scene or joke.

&amp;#x200B;

Have been interested in conspiracy theories all my life - been aware of QAnon movement for a while but haven't taken the time to really dig in to the non-surface level stuff. Caveat - I know that not everyone believes the same thing, looking for sentiment of the majority. If there are offshoot ideas that are supported by a solid number of people I'm interested in that too.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help clarify general beliefs on ""upstart"" politicians (for lack of a better word) like Bernie Sanders? Or even AOC? I mean, it seems like QAnon believes that Donald Trump is bucking the system - and that that is a positive. Wouldn't they support Sanders and AOC as because they are political figures that the establishment also tries to suppress?

&amp;#x200B;

Do people take issue with Bernie being in politics for decades, despite him not seeing much success? Is AOC's lack of support in this regard because they believe that her followers are mostly SJW types? Her policies seem pretty antithetical to what current Dems and Repubs want. Or am I totally misreading QAnon's core belief (that we need to revamp American society/politics as it currently functions)?

&gt;[President of the Muslim Association of Canterbury] said an electrician had tested the new electric locking system on Thursday, and then disengaged it for Friday prayers. He said that to open the door, somebody needed to turn a lever. It was just happenstance, and perhaps the cool weather that day, he said, which meant the door wasn't wide open as usual.  
&gt;""On any other Friday, the door would be open,"" he said.

&gt;...

&gt;When the gunman began to attack the Al Noor mosque, Ahmed Alayedy scrambled to get to the nearest emergency exit.  
&gt;He was the first one there.  
&gt;""I tried to open the door,"" he said.  
&gt;""But it doesn't open.""

&gt;...

&gt;Another survivor, Khaled Alnobani, says he thinks as many as 17 people may have died trying to get out through the door.  
&gt;Investigators have likely examined a new electric locking system installed on the door in the days before the attack. The mosque says an electrician disabled that system the day before the attack, although some of those who escaped question whether that was the case. What is clear is that nobody managed to open the door that afternoon.

I really think that transparency is the key to moderation. The single biggest thing that /r/conspiracy can do right now to improve moderation in the sub is to bring the public mod logs back online. 

The fact these can no longer be publicly viewed is really damaging to the single most important tool that keeps moderators honest and prevents abuse of power. Transparency. 

When people here have the ability to have an eagles eye view of which moderators are removing what comments, or which moderators are not removing comments, it’s a lot less likely that a person will take their comment or post being removed personally or feel that they’re being targeted or excluded from the conversation. For the mods to have a track record to be able to point back to and show they’ve consistently removed similar comments and posts, is so beneficial to the mods and the users. 

You can easily identify an out-of-control moderator through the public mod logs. In addition to the logs, having moderators be accountable to other moderators is also a great way to keep everyone honest.

&gt;GUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba — Military prosecutors say they have tapes of telephone calls between the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and three of his accused co-conspirators talking in code about the plot months before it took place, a defense lawyer disclosed on Monday.

&gt;The lawyer, Jay Connell, revealed the existence of the tapes as part of a protest over plans to use them as evidence at the death penalty trial of the alleged conspirators. More than 17 and a half years after the attacks — in which 19 hijackers commandeered four commercial airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, killing nearly 3,000 people — there is still no date set for the trial in the proceedings at Guantánamo Bay.

&gt;Prosecutors gave defense lawyers the original audio and transcripts of their translation on Sept. 30, 2016, Mr. Connell said, and made clear they planned to use them at trial. Defense lawyers sought to investigate their origins and later discovered that the original trial judge, Army Col. James L. Pohl, had issued a secret order preventing them from knowing about the phone call collection system or asking questions about it.

&gt;Mr. Connell, who is representing Mr. Mohammed’s nephew, Ammar al-Baluchi, said that prosecutors secretly obtained a ruling in August 2018 from Colonel Pohl forbidding defense lawyers from learning how the phone calls were collected or investigating that question. The phone calls in at least two languages were made between April and October 2001.

&gt;Mr. Connell said the restriction on investigating the origins of the tapes violated a defendant’s basic right to challenge the evidence being used against him. He argued in court on Monday that the evidence should be suppressed or that the case should be dismissed. He said the constraints the defense faces regarding the tapes violate the Sixth Amendment, which sets out the rights of defendants in a trial.

&gt;The military trial judges have yet to decide, however, which aspects of the Constitution apply at the military commissions, the war court established by President George W. Bush after the terrorist attacks.

&gt;A prosecutor, Clayton Trivett, responded that defense lawyers would be allowed to question an F.B.I. linguist who compared samples of the voices of the defendants to the voices on the tapes to confirm they were Mr. Mohammed, Mr. al-Baluchi and two other alleged plotters.

&gt;Mr. Trivett said defense lawyers would be allowed to question an F.B.I. analyst who decoded the conversation. The only restriction, he said, is on defense lawyers trying to investigate “how the United States government got those calls,” something prosecutors persuaded the judge would endanger national security.

&gt;Colonel Pohl had said prosecutors could describe the evidence as having been acquired from “telephone calls from between April and October 2001 that were later determined to pertain to the planned attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.”

&gt;Terry McDermott, co-author of “The Hunt for KSM,” said his research found that United States satellites “randomly scooped up” calls between Mr. Mohammed and an alleged deputy, Ramzi bin al-Shibh. “The N.S.A. intercepted calls but didn’t listen to them or translate them until after 9/11,” he said. “Afterward, they went through this stuff and found out what it was.”

&gt;Mr. Trivett did not disclose how or when the F.B.I. got voice samples of the accused plotters. Mr. Connell questioned in court whether they were recorded during the years that Mr. Mohammed and the other the defendants were held in the C.I.A.’s secret prison system.

&gt;Mr. Trivett announced that the samples were not from the C.I.A. black sites where the five alleged plotters were held before they were brought to Guantánamo for trial in 2006.

&gt;This week a new military judge, Col. Keith Parrella of the Marines, is hearing lawyers and prosecutors argue in the 34th round of pretrial hearings since the five men were arraigned in 2012.","Prosecutors say they have tapes of telephone calls between the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and three of his accused co-conspirators talking in code about the plot months before it took place, a defense lawyer disclosed on Monday."

&gt;Soros: Yes. That’s right. Yes.

&gt;60 Minutes: I mean, that’s — that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?

&gt;Soros: Not — not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don’t — you don’t see the connection. But it was — it created no — no problem at all.

This song is about programming a mind controlled slave. 

The song implies that when you loose consciousness you go to another place and are no longer in your body. That there can be things that happen to your body when you aren't conscious that you won't remember. Apart that could do things you could or would never do. It contains commands to self-harm with screams in the background. It talks about debt owed by their soul, about willing suicide.  About becoming totally subservient to their master to the point of death.

The real story behind the footage of Pauline Hanson aired on ABC this week is the fact that it happened during meetings at which the NRA was attempting to buy right-wing Australian politicians, just as they have successfully done in America. This is a sickening development, and a genuine conspiracy: the NRA wants guns in Australia and certain politicians here are happy to sell the safety of our country out.   
Hanson is a laughing stock in Australia with a long history of stupid gimmickry and racism. The politician she quoted from Parliament in 1987 has since come out to explain that his comments have been misunderstood. Hanson herself has since claimed that her quotes were somehow ""taken out of context"" and denied that she believes Port Arthur was a conspiracy. Neither of these points seem to have gained any traction in the discussions I've seen here, which I suppose is not surprising. But it is very sad.

- Only a few dozen exploits were revealed, although they are all pretty impressive, the CIA works in collaboration with US Hardware and Software manufacturers, I would think that they would have many more.

- the Shadow Brokers only leak were files leaked from the CIA TAO, not the NSA, DIA, or AFRL.

What would be the CIAs motive in this?

As many know, only a couple months after the Vault 7 leaks, the Petya cyberattacks and the Wannacry ransom attacks began, despite the fact that Russian banks and the Government were affected by the attacks, the USA and UK blamed Russia for the attacks, 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/uk-blames-russia-notpetya-cyber-attack-ukraine.

The USA holds a huge reserve of Bitcoin, this is mostly from the numerous Deep Web marketplaces they have taken over, but I theorize vast amounts of Bitcoin are held by the US as a result of the Wannacry attacks, perhaps this will be auctioned off, perhaps they are holding it for Economical Warfare purposes.

But why leak Vault 7? Because the CIA and other Intelligence Agency’s were free to blame anyone they liked because the exploit was easily available to whoever wanted it, there were likely other hackers to use it, but I suspect the USA was the first to spread Malware, the USA has control over almost all Fiber Cables, and Satellites which gives them complete control to the Internet, as a result, installation of this Malware on sensitive networks would be simple due to the NSAs Quantum Exploits which leverage this power.

3. What is your vision of /r/conspiracy in general?

I found /r/conspiracy on April 15, 2013. Patriots Day. This was also the day of the Boston Marathon Bombings, an event that REALLY put Reddit on the map for a lot of people. I was drawn here by the completely open sourced, hive mind driven manhunt that was taking place by millions of people all over the world, feverishly searching for answers to the sloppy false flag that was unfolding on the television screens across the world. 

The one that left more questions than answers to a vast majority of people who were watching it on TV. Tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of “global truthers” looking for better understanding, all in the same place working together to find out what the news media had so painfully been caught lying and concealing. I instantly fell in love with Reddit, and specifically /r/conspiracy that day when I witnessed the real-world power of what can happen with that many people focusing on the same thing so intently. 

When they had announced that they had captured the person responsible, and there was going to be a press conference at 5:00PM that day, which was subsequently cancelled after a bomb threat at the courthouse, then later denied that anyone had been captured, I deeply believe that Reddit, and the power of the hive mind collective rewrote history that day. 

They (the establishment and their mainstream media mouthpieces) had already come to a pre-determined outcome, which was completely thrown into chaos by pesky truthers. 

Over the next few days and weeks, I witnessed an unprecedented, vicious reaction by the establishment and their mainstream media mouthpieces directed at Reddit, and by extension, the millions of average every-day citizens motivated by a deep desire for Justice. ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, Vox, Daily Beast, Daily Caller, Daily Mail, Reuters, AP, The Atlantic, Media Matters, Huffington Post, BBC, Telegraph, and many others wrote hit piece after hit piece, condemning everyone for their ‘mis-directed’ focus away from the officially approved mainstream story.

The FBI even brazenly said at their press conference, there are a lot of photos out there floating around, and you should only consider photos and facts and evidence we provided! There were even politicians in Congressional hearings that were condemning Reddit, and the millions of people who were just trying to help that day.

Here I am thinking that what I just witnessed was the most awe inspiring, matrix breaking event in my life, and that those of us who participated in it should all be acknowledged and thanked, when entire legacy media ecosystem is screaming at me about how I’m such a bad person for looking at other evidence and coming to a different conclusion other then what the FBI provided. 

It was at this point that I TRULY understood how special of a place /r/conspiracy and Reddit can be when people come together and collectively work with each other to pursue the truth, and find answers to things together which are hidden from the mainstream narrative. 

This is why I’ve dedicated so much of my time and energy focusing on building up this sub and the people here. After having my intense red-pill experience here during the Boston Bombings, I decided to completely delete my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages and only focus on Reddit. Everything I have ever wanted our sought after from social media (mostly pretty potent dopamine shots) could be found daily right here on Reddit.

The magic that occurred back then, has been replicated time and time again in this sub over the years. The power of so many people seeking the truth who are driven mostly by a deep sense of Justice, equality, morality, and a strong sense of what is right congregating daily in the same spot is incredibly intoxicating. It literally just sent shivers down my spine. With that great power also comes great responsibility. Without checks and balances, the same power that millions of truth seekers can have for good, can just as easily be used for great harm and hatred. 

It’s very important I feel to reject anyone for this position whose motivation isn’t pure, or to continue building this sub to its peak of greatness. My vision for this sub is for it to continue to be a premiere destination for the exploration and discussion of topics and subjects that go against the grain or conventional thinking. I envision a completely inclusive, hate-free sub where anyone can visit, read, and post any idea or thought, free from the thought-police and wrong-think shackles which so many of us have placed on ourselves out of fear of being different or mocked. 

I sense that /r/conspiracy will continue to see the more and more users flock here, as other social media sites continue to censor and shun entire groups of people who threaten their narrative by critically thinking things.

I do see some danger ahead when an influx of newly homeless ‘white nationalists’ who have suddenly lost their home on other platforms begin looking for a new home. It’s very possible that this sub, due to its neo-openness and neo-inclusionary policies, will surely see an uptick in overtly racist posts and comments if this happens.

I’m positive however that this sub will be able to successfully reject and repel those people who come here with bad intentions, by thoroughly rejecting all voices who advocate violence and hate. The most powerful tool against hate-speech is love-speech.",3. What is your vision of /r/conspiracy in general?

This user asks this because the State is not sustainable, it continues to reach tragedy-of-the-commons/desertification in all of its functions and as Mrk Pasio talks about, only the HOWs are gone after and never the WHYs, the push-pull factors of a given conundrum, because so many are left-brain-dominant cynicism-afflicted would-be philosopher-kings or right-brain-dominant naviete-afflicted faithless slaves and that a money supply of paper fiat petrodollars which is worse than gold/silver-backed dollars, which still isn't that good, is STILL an old world way of handling transactions and the same 'people' (monstrs who think they'r descendants of alien overlords) have almost ALL the gold and silver AND created the paper system, so it's really just a transfer of money, a redistribution, of customers and capital/material between competing international and domestic monopolies, sects of Gews and/or 'tentacles' of the new world order, Rockefellr commies or Rthschild fashies, using FORCED association/diversity and FORCED disassociation/homogeneity to fight one another to keep people divided and conquered, NEITHER being the answer to the other's problems and libertarianism and voluntary association and voluntary disassociation and individualism stuck between a rock-and-a-hard-place as the common enemy.

It's really about options, at its core. Polycentricity. Of wont of a Polycentric Universe. Central planning does not work! Whilst there is scarcity in this world, any and all forms of distributism do.not.work!

A massive web of scandal and corruption is the ecosystem that brewed the Mueller scandal. It is considerably far more reaching that any news broadcast has been willing to talk about. Indeed, they are complicit and part of the same privatized intelligence machine that is a parasite upon the people of the United States. All races and all genders are affected by this deep seated corruption.

You abandoned all principles, all knowledge of the wicked history of the CIA and MI6, and pushed their genocidal propaganda on the rest of us.

No past searches or anything, just literally what you were talking about showing up online. 

Now I dont know if anyone else has experienced this but in the past few months mostly, if I am watching something on the PC and a term comes up on the TV show or movie that I am curious about so I open a tab to google what it means , before I finish what I am typing on Google, the first thing that pops up in the autocomplete suggestion box is that term I just heard and was about to just search it. 

Example, just now I am watching House and in the episode they start talking about AIP, acute intermittent porphyria, so I was not sure what that is so I open up Google and start typing ""A..C...U"" and BAM first search result is acute intermittent porphyria. This has happened constantly in the past few months alone. I have even tested it by watching an episode of The Office and when Dwight asked Creed if he knew what was on the picture he was showing  (Marijuana) , Creed responded Northern Lights cannabis indica. I went to Google exactly that and before I finished typing Northern, Google's auto search suggestion had Northern Lights Cannabis Indica as the second choice on the list. I was going to post a screenshot as an example but I dont think clearing history mattered and itll show up as a past search due to Google's learning algorithm. 

So what I am assuming is happening is the browser is listening constantly  (or maybe its Microsoft because Windows 10 has voice search option available, or both who knows anymore), and the last few words heard it recognizes and when you start typing in the search bar it suggests it.  I dont think its too far-fetched to imagine the possibility of that happening, just amazes me that we , or at least speaking for myself , are close to being numb about it that it doesnt realy change anything anymore. Would like to hear (read) anyone else's opinion or thoughts of this actually being possible and your experiences if you noticed this or something else weird happening like that. Makes you imagine what else could be next.

716,conspiracy,"This propagated vaccine craze has gotten so out of hand, it's become undoubtedly clear the ongoing fear mongering is nothing short of an orchestration by those who seek to profit from it. 


Here is some scientifically-backed research that dispels the idea that vaccines are as vital as the CDC makes them out to be.


Regarding Measles:

- The mortality rate of Measles had declined by almost 100% **before the vaccine was even introduced** in 1968*

[Here is the chart](http://healthimpactnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/G11.4-UK-Measles-1838-1978.png) that showcases the Measles mortality rate between the years 1838-1978. 


So how and why did the Measles death rate steadily decline without the introduction of vaccines?

**Factors such as hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, labor laws, electricity, chlorination, refrigeration, pasteurization, and many other facets that we now generally take for granted as part of modern life were all introduced/improved.**

Nutrition is key:

Discovered in the 1920s, vitamin A was dubbed the “anti-infective” vitamin. It alone has had a tremendous impact on measles deaths. During the 1990s, mortality reductions of 60 to 90 percent were measured in poor countries using vitamin A in hospitalized measles cases.

&gt; Combined analyses showed that massive doses of vitamin A given to patients hospitalized with measles were associated with an approximately 60% reduction in the risk of death overall, and with **an approximate 90% reduction among infants** . . . Administration of vitamin A to children who developed pneumonia before or during hospital stay reduced mortality by about 70% compared with control children. [1]

The availability of vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables was another factor responsible for the steep mortality reduction. There were improving trends in overall nutrition, as seen by a parallel in the decline in deaths from measles and the vitamin C deficiency disease, scurvy. Experiments done in the 1940s showed that vitamin C was effective against measles, especially when used in higher doses.

&gt; During an epidemic [of measles] vitamin C was used prophylactically and all those who received as much as 1000 mg. every six hours, by vein or muscle, were protected from the virus. Given by mouth, 1000 mg. in fruit juice every two hours was not protective unless it was given around the clock. It was further found that 1000 mg. by mouth, four to six times each day, would modify the attack; with the appearance of Koplik’s spots and fever, if the administration was increased to 12 doses each 24 hours, **all signs and symptoms would disappear in 48 hours.** [2]


Vaccines playing a miniscule role in the eradication of infectious diseases:


In 1977, a report was published that credited vaccines with, at best, approximately 3% of the mortality decline from infectious diseases.

&gt; In general, medical measures (both chemotherapeutic and prophylactic) appear to have contributed little to the overall decline in mortality in the United States since about 1900—having in many instances been introduced several decades after a marked decline had already set in and having no detectable influence in most instances. More specifically, with reference to those five conditions (influenza, pneumonia, diphtheria, whooping cough, and poliomyelitis) for which the decline in mortality appears substantial after the point of intervention—and on the unlikely assumption that all of this decline is attributable to the intervention . . . **it is estimated that at most 3.5 percent of the total decline in mortality since 1900 could be ascribed to medical measures introduced for the diseases** considered here. [3]


Regarding Whooping Cough and other infectious diseases:

In 1979, Sweden withdrew use of the DTP vaccine on the basis that it was not effective and possibly unsafe. They feared that with lower vaccination rates, the death rate would increase. 

In 1995, sixteen (16) years later, Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control indicated that deaths from whooping cough **remained near zero.**

&gt;  Sweden’s population was 8,294,000 in 1979 and 8,831,000 by 1995. From 1981 to 1993, eight children were recorded as dying, with the cause of death listed as pertussis. This averaged to be about 0.6 children per year possibly dying from whooping cough. These numbers show that the odds of dying from pertussis in Sweden were about 1 in 13,000,000 **even when there was no national vaccination program.** [4]

In the case of Scarlet fever disease, deaths declined to near zero **without any widespread vaccination.**


Vaccines acting as a danger to society:

**The measles vaccine does not create lifelong immunity, whereas natural infection with measles does.** 

The only way to remain immune with artificial immunity via vaccines is to be vaccinated several times during a lifetime. 

A 1984 study reported that:

&gt;By 2050, the proportion of measles susceptibles **may be greater than in the pre-vaccine era.** [5]

A 2009 study investigated what could happen with waning measles vaccine immunity even with high vaccine coverage among children.

&gt; We can foresee that vaccination will have two conflicting effects . . . it will reduce the number of newborn susceptibles and hence should have some of the usual associated public-health benefits reducing the number of cases in young children. However, **this reduction in cases will lead to a reduction in boosting and therefore a greater susceptibility to infection in older age classes** . . . When immunity wanes, vaccination has a far more limited impact on the average number of cases. While this observation has clear public-health implications, the dynamic consequences of the interaction between vaccination, waning immunity and boosting are far more striking. **For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced.** [6]


I'm going to share that last sentence again separately:

**For high levels of vaccination (greater than 80%) and moderate levels of waning immunity (greater than 30 years), large-scale epidemic cycles can be induced.**
















*Upon further research, 1968 is technically the second Measles vaccine. The original vaccine, originally introduced in 1963 was completely abandoned due to causing:

&gt; pneumonia as well as encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain)."" [7]

The vaccine also 

&gt; produced a “modified measles” rash in about half of those injected—essentially equivalent to a case of measles. Forty-eight percent of people had a rash, and 83 percent had fevers up to 106°F post-injection. [8]


For those who try to claim the decline showcased in the first chart was due to the 1963 vaccine, think again. A 1989 Report was published that claimed:

&gt; the 1963 vaccine was “not widely effective” and that the 1967 vaccine was unsta¬ble and lost its “effectiveness” if not properly refrigerated. **It was not until 1980** that a stable live measles vaccine became available. [9]

so they just not do their research? Do they not know about his many failed predictions starting from the very moment he first started posting?

is it that the majority of his fans get their information from cherry-picked posts in YouTube videos?

that's my theory. There's a lot of his fans are just people who heard about him through YouTube and didn't actually do any research it to him or read his posts

they probably don't even know when he started posting or what website he was using

And if it was really real and they truly believed it was real they wouldn't spend so much time trying to desperately prove that it was real

his proofs I'm out to he occasionally uses a word that Trump sometimes uses. Or maybe his tweet sounds somewhat similar to a different tweet that Trump made

but that's what the intelligence officials  spending all their time doing then it's pretty pathetic

I'm pretty sure most of the people following him weren't following him at the beginning. The people that were following him at the beginning gave up

but I'm pretty sure the people that continue to follow him  dontt do their research. They her some references to him in YouTube videos and assume he must be re

735,conspiracy,"So, ever since last year I noticed that I had the ability to predict things with a 90% accuracy. The first thing I predicted was the outcome of the South Carolina Gamecocks vs the Ole Miss Rebels Football game that happened last year. I predicted that the Gamecocks were going to win that game before the 3rd or 4th quarter began. They were losing at first, and the Gamecocks really do suck as a team (as i've heard from other people who watch Football), but somehow I was able to predict that they were going to catch up at the end of the game and beat the Rebels, which doesn't usually happen. Then I also made a future prediction that the Gamecocks were going to lose the next game against the Florida Gators (which also came true).

Here are the links to the games that happened late last year (note that while I was trying to remember the name of the first team that they beat before their match with the gators, I had guessed that it was Mississippi, but I didn't think it was Mississippi state that they went up against. ""Ole Miss"" popped up into my head, so I looked for Mississippi, and sure enough, that was the exact game that I was thinking about.)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\_South\_Carolina\_Gamecocks\_football\_team#at\_Ole\_Miss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football_team#at_Ole_Miss)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\_South\_Carolina\_Gamecocks\_football\_team#at\_Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football_team#at_Florida)

I've probably predicted far more things as well. But for the sake of brevity, i'm going to make this as short and sweet as I can. A few days ago, I was looking for the Amazing Atheists' video on Trayvon Martin (and btw, this happened years ago, and I don't remember what reignited my interest in this topic or what I wanted to know TJ's stance on it was for), and ""Justice for Trayvon"" had popped up into my head from out of nowhere, and I shit you not, that was the exact name of the video that TJ had uploaded. And btw, I haven't watched his videos in years.

Another thing is I can get sort of a detection that something bad is going to happen or happened. Not anything specific like world events, but I can just get a feeling that something isn't right. Like today when it was early in the morning and the news was on, I remember how the weather forecaster talked about how beautiful and shiny the sun is going to be today, and I remembered 9/11 and how peacefully that day started off, and I got a little bit freaked out. I was thinking that it may have been one of those ""all is calm before the storm"" moments. But nothing has happened on an international scale or anything significant personally (at least not as of yet).

I also started to remember weird things from my childhood as well as some weird trivial stuff that I haven't thought about in years (and I mean in over a decade now). Like for example, there was this Pokemon spin-off, kinda like Yu-Gi-Oh or Beyblade, but literally forgot what it was called until I somehow thought ""Duel Masters."" I don't know how the fuck I remembered that. Then I remembered that time this black kid had visited my house when I was a kid and wondered if he was the same kid who went to my elementary and middle school and still know on FaceBook. I might have to ask my grandmother about that. Then there was another WEIRD memory I had when I was with my grandmother (father's mother), and had put a hairband around my arm, and it felt really comfortable and good, and she kept trying to take it off, but then suddenly this white shit started oozing out. I then remembered this story about this woman who was having orgasms of her feet (footgasms, basically), and I remembered the strange concept of having orgasms with other parts of your body that aren't generally considered ""erogenous zones.""

As for other things I thought up, as for moving out of my mom/grandparents house and finding independence, I started getting these outside-of-the-box ideas that I had never thought of before. Like getting into contact with my mom's ex-friend and seeing if I can start dating her and if she would approve with helping me straighten my life out (although I would probably have to do it behind her back somehow), then I got another idea which I never thought of before, and that would be to call my mom's sister (an aunt to me; my mom HATES her, and she has done more damage to her than anybody) and tell her everything about my mom and see what she could do about it, but even if she couldn't get me out and have enough room to move me in, to at least ruin my mom some more. And then the last option if all the other options failed would be to try and apply for a drivers permit/license and getting a car (if they would let me do that). Because I remembered that just about every single failure in my life was entirely my mom's doing and not my own, EXCEPT for the driving part. I never bothered to read the manual because i'm too lazy for that, so instead if I really dedicated myself to it, and if they will let this work out for me, I could start reading that manual, taking driving lessons, etc. so that way I won't need to rely entirely on them for transportation, and I could rely on myself for that to get anywhere (like to a job, for example), and I would already be somewhat independent if I had my own car, even if I lived under their roof still. I also got a whole bunch of other ideas, but I won't go into them here.

As for the last thing that I can remember right now, was when I went on the 4plebs archive to look for some specific 4chan posts to see if I could find a specific fight video I saw a few years ago, but noticed that every time I clicked on the search bar, it would pop up and disappear. Every time I tried to click on it, it would do this. I got frustrated and asked somewhere online, but before anyone was able to answer, I got the idea of using a different browser and trying it to see if it will work. So, I then opened up Internet Explorer, tried it again, and it worked this time. Note that I have zero technical skills. I don't know how to script, code, or pretty much do anything like that. I just figured this out on my own somehow. There's plenty more examples that I can remember, but the for the sake of brevity am not including here, and some that I probably forgot.

Does anyone know an explanation for this? This has been happening since at least November 2018, and I don't think it's God, because i'm not really a follower of Christianity. What exactly could this be? Could it all just be a coincidence? That's possible, but very unlikely given how accurate these predictions are and how many times I got things right. Some things I haven't heard of in years and have completely escaped from my memory and don't know anymore are somehow popping up. Like the Duel Masters thing for example. The last time I watched that show was sometime back in the early 2000s, when I was a small child. I remembered having an action figure of the main character in the bath tub, and for some reason I remembered that as well as what it was from. ",Am I a psychic or something?

The 3 hoaxers are just fabricated identies. A fake name with a fake background commited fake suicide. Keeps the hoaxes alive, and it supplies the shills with emotion to appeal to.

I think this sub's users should consider stopping the use of the ""he'll be suicided soon"" trope.  This is often used here when a person may know too much about something. R conspiracy users post this trope at least once every post regurading anything even slightly important.. Hoax events, child trafficking, 911 etc

I think we should consider making an effort to reduce the frequency of this trope for a couple reasons. 

1) Do not normalize murder.  

2) Do not intimidate people into self-censorship. 

3) Do not promote violence.

So many people are claiming that the Sandy Hook father was ""suicided"" bc he was going to go public with the hoax.  In my opinion, many of the commenter that are posting this theory are doing so disingenuously as an intimidation tactic.  We know the deep state fakes deaths constantly, so why would this death be any different? To me, it's obvious that neither girl nor father actually killed themselves and no, neither of them were murdered by the goverment. If the government killed them to keep them silent, why plaster their stories all over the internet? If father was going to talk and you wanted to kill him, you could do it and not mention it.

Anyway, i know that not all commenters who perpetuate the ""suicided"" trope are doing so maliciously, but some are. Please consider my message. That is all. ","Regurading the recent Sandy Hook father suicide and r conspiracy's use of the ""suicided"" trope."

Here are some of the common tactics that shills like to use to try to control a discussion: (see how many you can spot in this comment thread!)

https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/the-25-rules-of-disinformation/

It's important to note, from the Gentleperson's Guide to Forum Spies, that these tactics only work *if people are not aware of them*. That's why shills get the most angry when you deconstruct their shilling and [logical fallacies](http://themillenniumreport.com/2017/07/internet-trolls-and-shills-experts-in-the-use-of-logical-fallacies/), because it deprives them of all their power and threatens their control over other users.

An important part of the shill ego is their belief that they are honest, and they are ""correcting the record"" by dishonest people. By refuting their dishonest tactics, you show them that they are actually not honest people, they are professional liars who have sold their soul. When they realize this, most become extremely demoralized, stop trying very hard, or quit and find gainful employment. Thus, it is actually a kind, virtuous act to confront a shill on their dishonest tactics, because it will lead to them earning more money, not having to lie for a living, and becoming honest, happy people.

Don't assume that ""everyone knows about the shills."" They don't. We get hundreds of new subscribers *per day.*

Don't repeat the claim ""don't feed the trolls."" That is bad advice. Countering propaganda requires that you [refute it in a timely manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpropaganda#Employed_rapidly), before it can affect perceptions.

One of the best ways to tell someone's motivation is by observing how they respond to people who expose shills and their methods. The normal profile of a person who comes to a board to discuss conspiracies is that they hate propaganda and want honest discussion. So, it's very much out-of-place when you see someone defending shills, minimizing their harm, or (most telling) attacking anyone who talks about shills.

A few of these people are totally new and/or have terrible discernment. The rest are either paid shills, or unpaid trolls like Top Losers, who sit in their parents' basements and, like the angry children they are, do everything they can to disrupt the grown-ups while we are having a conversation.

If you are one of the small group of people who are not shills or trolls but attack people who talk about them, stop it. You are literally acting as an agent of the people you are trying to expose and stop.

If you are a paid shill, remember that you are impotent hobgoblins on the wrong side of history. You have no power to influence discussions like the ones we have here, because we know all of your plans. You are selling your soul to the devil for a few bucks an hour. You would be much happier and wealthier if you got minimum wage at McDonald's, producing an actual good that has economic value and might brighten someone's day a little bit. With your extra money and self esteem, you might be able to go to junior college or trade school, and really get your life headed in a better direction.

Or, you can live with the bone-crushing shame and possible [jail time](http://progressivearmy.com/2016/10/08/exposed-clinton-campaign-violated-campaign-finance-laws/) that will come when this whole thing comes crashing down, and everyone you know realizes that you were supporting things like the Military-Industrial Complex, elite pedophilia, and mass genocide.

751,conspiracy,,No Collusion: Mueller Knew Months Before Midterms
752,conspiracy,"This is a bit long, but here we go....

  

He would have to bring down himself and all his people!  
 

From 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation.  
 

A Grand Jury had been empaneled.  
 

Governments from around the world had donated to the “Charity”.  
 

Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations” to the Clinton Foundation were declared.  
 

Hmmm, now you would think that an honest investigator would be able to figure this out.  
 

Guess who took over this investigation in 2002?  
 

Bet you can’t guess.  
 

No other than James “Wassup Homey” Comey.  
 

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?  
 

Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS?  
 

Your friend and mine, our favorite person in the whole world if you are a Tea Party Member, Pro-Life or a True the Vote supporter……. ding, ding, ding, ding Lois “Be on The Look Out” (BOLO) Lerner.  
 

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?  
 

It gets better, well not really, but I am sure this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right?  
 

Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?  
 

No other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.  
 

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?  
 

Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this timeframe???  
 

I know, it’s a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, Robert Mueller.  
 

What do all four casting characters have in common?  
 

They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.  
 

Now that’s just a coincidence, right?  
 

Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance.  
 

Let’s fast forward to 2009, shall we?  
 

James “Wassup Homey” Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.  
 

Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.  
 

The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hildabeast.  
 

Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to no other than, the Russians.  
 

Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn’t, the People got absolutely nothing out of it.  
 

However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Arkansas Bill goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.  
 

Ok, no big deal right?  
 

Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.  
 

Guess who was the FBI Director during this timeframe?  
 

Yep, Robert Mueller.  
 

He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.  
 

Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland.  
 

No other than, Rod Rosenstein.  
 

Guess what happened to the informant?  
 

The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.  
 

Interesting, huh?  
 

How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?  
 

Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved?  
 

\~145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.  
 

Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?  
 

No other than, Lois “BOLO” Lerner.  
 

Interesting, huh?  
 

Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?  
 

Let’s fast forward to 2015.  
 

Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that the Hildabeast ran the State Department on a unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.  
 

He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law.  
 

He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email.  
 

I will spare you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for the Hildabeast.  
 

Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?  
 

Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer.  
 

No other than James “Wassup Homey” Comey.  
 

Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh?  
 

Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her.  
 

Nope couldn’t find any crimes there.  
 

Can you guess what happened next?  
 

In April 2016, James “Wassup Homey” Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.  
 

They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury.  
 

Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true “Gangsta” Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates the Hildabeast from any wrongdoing.  
 

Can you see the pattern?  
 

I could go on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.  
 

FISA Abuse, political espionage..... pick a crime, any crime, chances are...... this group and a few others did it.  
 

All the same players.  
 

All compromised and conflicted.  
 

All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.  
 

All connected in one way or another to the Clinton's.

773,conspiracy,"The Cube. Why does this damn thing keep showing up?

[ \\""All art intuitively apprehends coming changes in the collective unconsciousness.\\"" - C.G. Jung ](https://i.redd.it/cjgt1jnwcpo21.png)

In *The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature* (1967), Carl Jung states that “the artist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks his own ends, but one who allows art to realize its purposes through him.” He goes on to say that the artist is “one who carries and shapes the unconscious, psychic life of mankind.” He tells us that this force is “a force of nature that achieves its end either with tyrannical might or with the subtle cunning of nature herself, quite regardless of the personal fate of the man who is its vehicle”. Jung enforces the ‘tortured artist’ motif, the idea that the artist is someone who must create, even if it means sacrificing their own well-being.

The famous psychiatrist portrays the artist as a messenger for mankind, someone who sometimes acts as a vessel for a divine force. Art is then looked at as the way the collective unconscious’ communicates with the humanity. According to its definition, art is “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination”. By virtue, this makes film and even videogames the most popular art form of our technological age. We could then safely say someone like Stanley Kubrick was a great artist of our time and modern day myth maker. Rather than reading epics on stone tablets or parchments, we now watch them on screens. But what are the modern day myths trying to tell us?

In the picture above I have compiled a collection of movies, video games, sculptures and a few other forms of art that are telling a story about a cube (or in the case of sculptures, presenting the symbol). From right to left, up to down, are: *Cube*(1997), *Fortnite* (2017), *Hellraiser* (1987), *Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubicus)* (1954), *Star Trek* (1966), *An Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and Its Kindred Sciences* (1894), *Transformers* (1984), *2036 Origin Unknown* (2018), *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), *Subnautica* (2018), *The Avengers* (2012), *The Cube ""Endover""* (1968), pages from Leonardo Da Vinci’s notebook describing Metatron’s Cube, *La Tête au Carré* (2002), and *Action Comics #263* (1960). Within these stories, the cube’s role differs, but there are consistent themes. The cube is typically seen as something powerful and otherworldly. Sometimes it is seen as ancient. Other times it seems to symbolize the material world as a whole. Its also often referred to as a tesseract, or a four dimensional cube, the fourth dimension being time.

Another theme that echoes throughout these stories is the cube’s association with the planet Saturn. This is fitting because in Roman and Greek mythology, Saturn is the god of time. Jungian psychology correlates Saturn with the Shadow and equates it as a planetary archetype to senex, or the wise old man. In his negative form he appears as the devouring father, Kronos. Jung struggled against this archetype later in life. This was one of driving forces behind his seclusion that produced The Red Book. Jung was fascinated by astrology claiming that it “represents the sum of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity”. He liked to wrestle with the question of how such synchronicity occurs between terrestrial events and astrological constellations. Do the planets, namely Saturn, chief of them all, have some sort influence on the world?

Anyways, one artistic masterpiece I'd like to focus on is Subnautica.

""Subnautica is an open world survival adventure video game developed and published by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. It allows the player to freely explore the ocean on an alien planet, known as planet 4546B, collecting unique resources to survive.""

First of all this game is amazing. The scenery is beautiful, the creatures are awesome, the story is cool - I love it. If you have't played it you should (also spoiler alert). But one thing I found really interesting is the symbolism towards the end of the game. There’s a temple at the bottom of the ocean with a powerful artificially intelligent cube inside. It's ancient and its from aliens. Sound familiar?

[The picture says it all](https://i.redd.it/y1jjwjl5cpo21.png)

Also inside the temple is a Lovecraftian-like being. If you've read my previous posts you know I've talked about inter-dimensional aliens more likely being squid-like rather than reptilian-like. Perhaps H.P. Lovecraft was channeling some truth into his writings. That could possibly be why they resonated with the collective unconscious and became so popular. We could say the temple is reminiscent of R'lyeh.

[Sea Emperor Leviathan](https://i.redd.it/8oh8g5oacpo21.png)

Perhaps this being and the cube are a nod to the shapeshifters from Saturn? We could also say that the powers at be are shapeshifters in a another sense other than literal. This term could be a manifestation of how we feel about the two faced-ness of the politicians who take part in the Saturnian control system. I’ve also theorized that many tentacled monsters could subconsciously represent the madness the intellect experiences as one tries to go deeper within and approaches the void. The Kraken protects the void because within the void is where true peace and power lie. This is the hidden treasure at the bottom of the One Mind’s ocean.

[Zen, the Void](https://i.redd.it/wgbe6mvecpo21.png)

But still the question lingers, what does this all mean? Is the collective unconscious trying to tell us something about the matrix-like nature of reality?

Jung never spoke about the symbolism of the cube (he realized the significance of the Nature of Four nevertheless), however, he did have a cube of his own that was very important to him. One day, the Swiss doctor ordered some stones for an enclosing wall he was building. He wanted to build one around his garden at his second home, the Bollingen Tower. But when masons from the local quarry showed up, they accidentally brought the wrong cornerstone. Rather than the triangle piece Jung originally ordered, they brought what he called “a perfect cube”. One mason was furious and tried to return it immediately but Jung exclaimed “No, that is my stone, I must have it!” For some reason that he could not explain, he was drawn to it. He decided to chisel phrases and symbols onto its sides. Ironically, the front side is etched with a passage about time.

777,conspiracy,"I'll have to find sources for this, but it's my understanding that China has a long history of politically subversive movements hiding in plain sight as new religious movements. This phenomenon is by no means unique to China, but it's precedented enough there that dynasties have fallen at the hands of radical sects. As a result most Chinese leaders have learned to be preemptively mistrustful and suppressive of any non-state-sanctioned new religious movement that gains widespread popularity. I should note here that China has long had a spiritual concept called the Mandate of Heaven, whereby it is the people's *moral duty* to rise up against and overthrow a corrupt leader.

Shen Yun, a traditional Chinese dance troupe founded in New York City, is owned and operated by Falun Gong, a highly popular and radical sect of the indigenous Chinese religion whose persecution by the Chinese Communist Party has received international attention. The stated aim of Shen Yun is to preserve and promulgate traditional Chinese forms of entertainment that are deprecated by the CCP. I have never seen Shen Yun, but I am struck by how large and inescapable their advertising campaign has been here in the northeastern US. Falun Gong obviously has deep pockets, and is obviously making a lot of money on these highly popular performances. I've spoken to people who've seen the performance, and it seems to be achieving its aim of increasing Americans' appreciation for traditional Chinese culture.

It wouldn't surprise me if the leaders of Falun Gong were playing a long game of infiltrating and undermining the CCP. A part of this could involve the projection of soft power in the West, by creating a populace sympathetic to Falun Gong's self-described stewardship of real Chinese culture, such that when the ax is dropped, much of the world thinks the change is for the good.

Bob is a restaurant owner.  Bob and other restaurant owners can apply to win contracts in which he will receive a large sums of money after making food for many, many people. The problem is, the kitchens he is required to make the food in have a few inherent problems which cannot be fixed and people sometimes get food poisoning. Bob is always given a choice, however.

Choice 1: He can prepare food for citizens.  If citizens become ill they can come back later and be compensated from Bob's earnings.

OR

Choice 2: He can prepare food for prisoners.  Regardless of how many prisoners get ill, Bob keeps all of his money because the prisoners are taken care of under a different program.

His choices are between making a product for which he could be held accountable and making a product for which he will not be held accountable.  

**This is the simple answer as to why the childhood vaccination schedule advocated by the CDC has ballooned to ridiculous proportions**.



In 1986 Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), creating a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits.  

Vaccine makers have a choice. They can make vaccines for everyone and face liability if their product damages or kills someone.

OR

They can manufacture and pioneer invention **in childhood vaccines, specifically, which inherently holds no risk of liability**.

This is the only reason the CDC says kids ""need"" the insane number of shots these days.  The suppliers are manufacturing demand in a population held hostage.  Bob would far rather make food for prisoners, when given the choice. Financially, it is the safest way to go.

815,conspiracy,"Personally I believe in this theory for 101%. There is just too much to explain. I myself have been learning programming for about 7/8 years. I am able to write my own A.I. (simple one but still :) ). Also I have a pretty good understanding of biology and physics. When you compare the way A.I. and other technology works with the way our universe works, it is almost exactly the same!

Take a look at Darwin's Theory of evolution. Living  organisms evolve very slowly, generation by generation and after a long time, flaws slowly get 'patched'. A neutral network works the same.
Let's say we have an A.I. that is made to complete a Super Mario Bros level flawlessly. It starts with knowing nothing. First it tries something, let's say walk forward and it fails, then based on the results of it's previous move results, it makes another move. It does this till until it can complete the level perfectly. By the time it has done this it will be on about the 30th 40th generation depending on the complexity of the level. If you want you can watch this video about an A.I. learning to play Mario: https://youtu.be/qv6UVOQ0F44

If you look at let's say the human body. It works almost exactly the same as a computer. You have a processor (your brain), you have short term memory (RAM), long term memory (ROM) etc.. Your brain has neurons in it interacting with each other. They do this by sending light signals (explained very quickly) back and forth. This is exactly the same as optical fiber. If a neuron fires light, it's a 1, if it does not fire, it's a 0. This is also how binary works.
Also your immune system is just amazing!! You really need to watch this video about it!!: https://youtu.be/zQGOcOUBi6s
Everything is just so perfect every single time that it has to be some kind of algorithm.
And the immune system isn't the only algorithmic aspect of life. For example you have the Fibonacci sequence. A actual algorithm that you can see everywhere! And a lot more! Video about it: https://youtu.be/wTlw7fNcO-0

The smartest A.I. that exists is a Japanese robot. It is about as smart as a cockroach. But in a few years, especially with the future help of the quantum computer we will create an A.I. that is as smart as a human. This is called the singularity and is estimated to take place in 2043. And the thing with A.I. (and most animals including humans) is that the smarter it becomes, the father it learns. This creates an infinite loop in which it will learn faster and faster until it will turn into some all knowing higher being.
We would be able to literally simulate consciousness inside of a being that is smarter then the human species will ever get. We are already capable of simulating the big bang. So if we will be able to do that in a couple of years, what is the chance that some other advanced civilization didn't already do this and we are their A.I.?
Elon Musk actually answered this question and the answer is: The chance that we are NOT simulated is one in BILLIONS. The chances we are simulated are actually way bigger then the chance we aren't.

Think of it like this. We humans use other dumber animals for experiments. To test medicine and such. We look at rats and monkeys to learn from they behaviour.
What if we are just a bunch of lab rats. What if the advanced civilization that simulated us did so because they wanted to see how we evolve, how we revolutionize and what we invent so they can learn and benefit from it. ",Reality is simulated and humans are just 'lab rats'

The Unthinkable

In early October 2001, when anthrax scares and letters were at their height, the media frequently employed the word ""unthinkable"" to describe an anthrax or bioweapons attack by an enemy. MacQueen cites seven influential outlets (e.g., NYT, CNN, USA Today) among many. Who pushed the media into peddling this meme? MacQueen doesn't say, but he concludes "". . . there is a pattern here."" He says it might not be a conspiracy, "". . . but whatever the origins of the 'unthinkable' discourse, it deserves investigation and contemplation"" which he proceeds to do.

For many years before 2001, ""the unthinkable"" had been used as a term among those who studied and participated in American war strategy to refer to nuclear war, traced to Herman Kahn's famous book, Thinking about the Unthinkable. Kahn gave the term a quasi-technical status which was accepted by many subsequent writers. How did ""unthinkable"" as a term for nuclear weapons get morphed into a term for bioweapons in 2001?

In 1972, the U.S. and Soviet Union signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), a pillar of the Cold War strategy of nuclear deterrence. The superpowers agreed to renounce the attempt to build weapons of defense against nuclear missiles. They gave up military defense on the understanding that the prospect of nuclear retaliation by the enemy was so horrifying that each side would be deterred from attacking the other. MacQueen writes, ""This was an unusual agreement in the history of warfare and came about due to the spectacular destructiveness of nuclear weapons and the fact that no technology had been invented to offer a significant defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles.""

On May 1, 2001, President Bush gave a major foreign policy speech at Ft. McNair putting the public on notice that the U.S. intended to unilaterally withdraw from the ABM Treaty. A signatory could withdraw as long as they gave six months notice and was able to cite ""extraordinary events"" that have ""jeopardized its supreme interests."" Bush put the proposed withdrawal in terms of good (us) versus evil (Soviets), and that since the evil Soviet Union no longer existed and Russia was democratic, cuts in nuclear arsenals were thus possible. In other words, he invokes everyone to leave behind the relics of the Cold War era such as the ABM Treaty. How clever and convenient, right?

Bush then explained that there were new dangers at hand – ""weapons of mass destruction"" – a phrase which at that time referred only to nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and biological weapons. These weapons were in the hands of ""some of the world's least responsible states."" When Bush spoke of making a shift to ""a new framework,"" Bush said the U.S. must be willing to ""rethink the unthinkable."" The expression had not been used on a comparably important occasion. In this context, it meant be aware of 1) terrorism and 2) rogue states with WMDs, both events which would shortly come to pass (i.e., the 9/11 attack, followed by the anthrax attacks). Either George Bush has incredible prescience, or foreknowledge was at work.

The ""new framework"" had actually already been expressed in a PNAC document in 2000 whose members had been trying for years to invade and take over Iraq and establish a Pax Americana. One of the key recommendations of the PNAC document is to create a defense capability to enable a policy of aggression, or threat of same, by eliminating the target entity's ability to launch a retaliation.

In other words, the U.S. needed to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. The Bush White House used the pretext of the 9/11 attack to withdraw from the ABM Treaty on December 13, 2001. MacQueen argues (with references) that the withdrawal was ""a top-down decision made by a small number of men engaging in minimal consultation with others inside the U.S. security community.""

The problem is that although the 9/11 attacks were horrific, they had little to do with the ABM Treaty, as there was no nuclear weapons involved and not even a ""weapons of mass destruction."" By December 13, the White House had dropped the claim that al Qaeda and/or Iraq were responsible for the anthrax attacks since by then it was well-established to be a domestic operation. So there was no ""extraordinary event"" to permit a withdrawal from the ABM Treaty based on the treaty's tenets. The Bush White House did it anyway with a high-school sophomore's level of justification.

MacQueen writes that ""the expression 'the unthinkable,' whether part of a plan or not, functioned as part of a transitional discourse, taking citizens from the horrors of the Cold War to the horrors of the new framework: the Global War on Terror.""

(pro-SPEAR-uh-see) A secret plan by a group of people to do something good for another person or group of people. The opposite of a conspiracy.

At a low point while delving into the conspiracy realm I decided to actively search out those who are doing the opposite of all the examples and possibilities of nefarious and uncaring actions many of us have become acquainted with here and in other platforms.

I found an incredible wealth of initiatives and actions that many good folks are doing not only in resistance to greedy and at times psychopathic machinations of ""progress"" but solely for the sense and propulsion of acts of kindness and concern for well being. If these examples were what was the focus of the narrative we are awash with I think our experience could be quite different.

Two decades ago I was of the belief that the system, our elected officials, and masters of industry were enacting initiatives for enhancing our shared experience. Whether I am now more awake to reality or have taken on a pessimistic perspective, I find it a challenge to find incidences of the ""deciders"" protecting rights and privacy, improving water and food quality, mirroring and expecting ethics and justice, making education better, curbing spending, promoting health, etc.

After this shift I began to look for leaked emails, FOIA requests, laws, and initiatives by those SWORN to represent the needs and rights of citizens that would be Prospiracies. Rights seem to be vanishing, inequality expanding, regulations favouring the haves, all need based costs rising while wages are stagnant, etc…

My intention in writing this is to either be enlightened to what I am missing as far as collective progress goes or to get support in my perspective of the lack of ability and concern from those who are presented as representatives. Do you have ANY input that is descriptive of furthering health and welfare of citizens?",Prospiracy. What a concept.

846,conspiracy,"Hospitals over-inflate the cost of healthcare to a ridiculous degree. This is only possible because the insurance companies pay healthcare providers a severely reduced rate, a price much closer to the actual cost of providing that healthcare. The problem with that is people who are above the welfare line but who have bad insurance plans with high deductibles get completely screwed over and have to pay that ridiculously over priced cost out of pocket (sometimes even up to $4000 before their insurance kicks in). Then you get stories like this one where a kid stops taking insulin because their family can't afford it and dies [https://local12.com/news/local/cost-of-living-local-mother-tells-congress-about-losing-daughter-who-rationed-insulin](https://local12.com/news/local/cost-of-living-local-mother-tells-congress-about-losing-daughter-who-rationed-insulin)

866,conspiracy,"I’d like to first start off by saying that I have no definite concrete smoking gun evidence for either Joe or Alex being controlled opposition agents. Something like that would be very difficult to acquire and bring to the attention of this culture, because of the emphasis on secrecy and classification within the global crime syndicate. What I can do, is show you some of the information I’ve stumbled across, and offer an analysis of their behavior and how it could pertain to the concept of them being compromised. 

First off, the idea of controlled opposition is not new. Knowing that a discussion among the public regarding their situation and their indentured servitude would be imminent, TPTB often place their own “agents” in charge of these movements to ensure they have total control over the scenario. Vladimir Lenin once said, “the best way to defeat the opposition, is to lead it ourselves”. Simply put, taking control of any sort of “liberty” movement allows them to steer it in any direction they want and dictate the climate of discussion that takes place within it.

Let’s start with Alex Jones, because there is a relatively strong case to be made for him being a controlled opposition agent. 

There have been several instances of Alex Jones being disingenuous and often flat out fabrication/lying. The interview with Bill Cooper stands out, because he attacks him and claims Bill was using profanity and being belligerent when on his show as a guest. Bill Cooper denies this, and the recording of that segment proves it to be blatantly false. Bill would go on to warn the truth community about the influence of Alex Jones, referring to him as a potential “traitor” within the truth movement, leaking important information on other prominent truth seekers and discrediting the movement. Why would Alex dedicate a segment of his show to criticize and berate a fellow member of the truth movement? 

https://youtu.be/ydC4Y4AyYPQ

There is also the matter of Alex Jones having admitted to his family having connections to the intelligence agencies, which would provide evidence for a potential link to the CIA, which was and still is likely involved in infiltration of alternative media platforms.

https://youtu.be/bBMXmjVr954


https://youtu.be/Azp7s4mEdGc

Regarding Jones, perhaps what is most important and often misunderstood is how his outlandish and abrasive demeanor is counterintuitive to representing the conspiracy culture, which is already deemed to be “crazy and insane”. At time, it seems as if jones is purposely acting in this manner to discredit conspiracy theorists further, and reinforce the idea of theorists being crackpot looneys. Here are just a few examples.

Alex Jones “debates” Piers Morgan on guns

https://youtu.be/O5qNXHTaK6A

Alex Jones frequently talking over guests 

https://youtu.be/jWEY_XptHUU

And perhaps the most incriminating example, Alex Jones infiltrates a pro 2nd amendment rally, and begins talking over the protestors with a bullhorn, annexing their protest, and the assemblers become upset and puzzled as to why he’s there and why he’s acting in such a way. 

https://youtu.be/f3s0vAwsBNc

Regarding Joe Rogan, it’s slightly more difficult to make the case that he is potentially controlled opposition, partly because he has only been relevant within the “conspiracy culture” for the last decade or show, whereas Jones has been prominent for over 20 years. Rogan also presets himself as merely a “dumb monkey who smokes weed and is curious about the world”, not outright identifying as somebody concerned with government accountability, civil liberties, etc. as Jones does. 

However, Joe was known for having entertained several conspiracy theories, including 9/11, the moon landing, ancient civilizations, and several others. Conspiracy theorists enjoyed his earlier podcasts for years because conspiracy related discussion was encouraged and welcomed, and a myriad of guests like Duncan Trussel and Graham Hancock would frequent the show.

Within the last few years, His “tone” regarding conspiracy content seems to have changed drastically. Many of the theories he was willing to entertain, he has since “flipped” on and no longer endorses or is even willing to allow a discussion of them to happen on his show. 

This video is relatively long, but I recommend scanning through it, to get an idea of how Joe has “flipped” on many of his previous stances regarding conspiracy theories.

https://youtu.be/DpLb2OqBWhs

Joe even went so far as to develop and participate in a show called “Joe Rogan Questions everything”, which is centered around taking on conspiracy theories and debunking them. Rogan is particularly known for being a staunch denier of the geoengineering/chemtrail theory, which has a fair amount of circumstantial evidence to support.

https://youtu.be/svwlefBW7rk

It almost seems as if Joe had been approached before by a group of influential figures or members of an intelligence agency, and persuaded to stop advocating for the discussion of taboo subjects. Even one of Joes most popular guests, Duncan Trussel, has alluded to this possibility, and Joe’s reaction is rather aggressive and bizarre when confronted. 

https://youtu.be/HliGRyEctLw

Rogans podcast is massively popular, and millions of people are reached with each episode. Approaching Joe, compromising him, coaching him on how to present himself as a more “mature” truth seeker seems to be the method their using. Almost as if he’s treating conspiracy theories as this “immature phase” he went through, which reflects back on his listeners, encouraging the same behavior. 

Another odd thing I recall about Rogan is when he admitted to (perhaps jokingly) being open to the idea of selling out, in exchange for disclosure of some kind of revelation of the truth from TPTB.

https://youtu.be/p_-JG2YpBNk

As I mentioned earlier, there is never going to be an absolute smoking gun or a blatant paper trail to follow that links alternative media figures to being shills. It doesn’t work that way. We can only speculate, but educated speculation is something this culture has often relied on to arrive at conclusions. 

Ask yourself this question; In recent years, what have either Joe or Alex done for you, to extend the benefit of the doubt to them that they are 100% dedicated to truth and non biased discussion?
